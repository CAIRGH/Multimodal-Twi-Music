Christianity has become too many problems
Things are not the same anymore Kristo som ay3 ns3m pii
15 ways to be successful, 13 ways to make much money, but the 1 way to make to heaven, preacher man u don't preach about it.
Last Sunday I heard u preach I must confess I was confuse was that church of Kimpa
Panananaaa naaaa na naaa (2x)
Say things are not the same anymore
Christianity has become too many problems
Millions the target for the next harvest for how else can we buy
the preachers dream car
Yet in the same church with Mr. Aboagye who can even afford a three square meal
Things are not the same anymore may he be slaughtered for the shepherd

Pits were dug for me
They swore that

Thank You Lord, From the bottom of my heart, I thank You
But see what God has done
I appreciate what You have done for me
A barren one like me
Me that did not matter at all, today Iâm fruitful
Today I am also getting married
God You are mysterious, You have done well
