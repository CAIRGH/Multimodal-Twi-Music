Look at me, the drunk has taken his room
I say it’s really bad
The day God comes physically
If you don't consider it well, watch and see Heaven won't get people
Because the truth is there, but these pastors can't speak
Because of money, the chapel can't get children (they can’t get children)
Even there, things fall apart
