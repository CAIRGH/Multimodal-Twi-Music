Move!! Even the struggle!! Bars!!
Call me Kofi Kinaata
We hustle in the morning, he and the dawn go together
We are not resting, the time is not for idleness
From drinking, may he not do the work and not eat
So this is why I hustle and work hard
But Iâm looking for something to eat
Itâs painful how things changed between us
The struggles I see are like dark journeys
But now, go and see my town
They say that I should have something, but I donât remember them
But you don't know that he is not sleeping
If he is even sleeping, then the soldiers will not guard him
Now go and see my town
They say that I should have something, but I donât remember them
You donât know that he is not sleeping
If he is even sleeping, then the soldiers will not guard him
Look at things for me so I can say what I need to say
Not all the things on the journey are what we say
So, I have given all my words to God
God himself is not a liar
As a hustler, I donât have a place to go
Even when Iâm sick, I rely on God to heal me
Aww Jehovah God who makes You whistle
May He not wear a jersey to score a hat-trick
Jehovah God who makes You whistle
May He not sit on the bench and receive the Goal King
I wonât let enemies mock us
I wonât let them bring fear to our hearts
We wonât let them say that God who we serve is not with us
This battle is not ours
Let me see and speak, not just for you to say
Not all the things on the journey are what they say
But now, go and see my town
They say that I should have something, but I donât remember them
But you don't know that he is not sleeping
If he is even sleeping, then the soldiers will not guard him
Now go and see my town
They say that I should have something, but I donât remember them
You donât know that he is not sleeping
If he is even sleeping, then the soldiers will not guard him
Yayyy!!
Aw wow oooo
Someone is also going ooo aw wow oooo
Yayyy!!
We are tired ooo
Yay!!
We are tired ooo
So
I wonât let enemies mock us
I wonât let them bring fear to our hearts
I wonât let them say that God who we serve is not with us
This battle is not ours
Let it be known that it has been a long time since I worked on this
I say I will look for it and take it, it has been a long time since I found it
Brother, donât look for it here when we were here before
I say I will look for it here, even if I take it, it will not be the same as before
But now go and see my town there
They say that I should have something, but I donât remember them
But you don't know that he is not sleeping
Travel and See oo!!!
But now go and see my town
They say that I should have something, but I donât remember them
But you don't know that he is not sleeping
If he is even sleeping, then the soldiers will not guard him
Now go and see my town
They say that I should have something, but I donât remember them
You donât know that he is not sleeping
If he is even sleeping, then the soldiers will not guard him
If he is even sleeping,
Then the soldiers will not guard him",Highlife,"The song expresses the struggles and hustle of life, emphasizing the importance of perseverance and hard work.

I donât see anything (Ah, canât you see that Iâm looking good?) x1

People say, even the nightlife can drink schnapps

Itâs like someoneâs husband is plastered to this
Is God really important, why do we worship?
Look at me, the drunk has taken his room
I say itâs really bad
The day God comes physically
If you don't consider it well, watch and see Heaven won't get people
Because the truth is there, but these pastors can't speak
Because of money, the chapel can't get children (they canât get children)
Even there, things fall apart
They say, anointed men touch
This chapel, they are mostly in schools
But these members can't even go there
So is God really important, why do we worship?

You've made the gospel into a joke

Disasters, problems, and the church won't change anything
If youâre in your town, the water is down, pack it up
Everyone says heâs a bad man

293,Segment_15_Kofi Kinaata - Things Fall Apart.mp3,Kofi Kinaata - Things Fall Apart,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTAFC8aAQ5g,Fante,"We are coming, we are coming well
We are coming, we are coming, pause
Call me Kofi Kinaata, move!
Friday Chapel all night, Saturday we are in the club
We are doing more things, amen, shocker in the cup
The spirit is here, and the Bible has come with it
People say, even the nightlife can drink schnapps
So when girls are in chapel, you go and do it
Come and see, they are also in the club
So is God really important, why do we worship?
Ask your sibling, and also ask yourself
Is God really important, why do we worship?
When the Jehovah's come, this is how they will be
So is God really important, why do we worship?
Itâs like someoneâs husband is plastered to this
Is God really important, why do we worship?
Look at me, the drunk has taken his room
I say itâs really bad
The day God comes physically
If you don't consider it well, watch and see Heaven won't get people
Because the truth is there, but these pastors can't speak
Because of money, the chapel can't get children (they canât get children)
Even there, things fall apart
They say, anointed men touch
This chapel, they are mostly in schools
But these members can't even go there
So is God really important, why do we worship?
Ask your sibling, and also ask yourself
Is God really important, why do we worship?
You've made the gospel into a joke
So is God really important, why do we worship?
And if your sibling is not careful, it can't take them away
Is God really important, why do we worship?
Tell me, how do we not die, and why is this bittersweet? (Amen)
This pastor is a thief, take care
And if this is true, theyâll die when they drink
Look, I saw how you died when you drank
This pastor is a thief, take care
He says heâs an American Muslim, he drinks everywhere
And people die when they drink
Look, itâs not about Christians, itâs not about Muslims, itâs not about others, itâs not about pastors,
Itâs not about prophets, just anyone
Disasters, problems, and the church won't change anything
If youâre in your town, the water is down, pack it up
Everyone says heâs a bad man
Thatâs why lecturers want you to fail before you pass
For money, you will shed blood
God will do, He will take care; we canât; we want it fast
So fast life, fast cars, fast traps
Church service there, but itâs for Snapchat gods
31st in the church
He gives himself to God, on the 3rd he takes off to trek
Haha, part-time Christian
You want to fight a full-time devil
You are joking
So is God really important, why do we worship?
Is God really important, why do we worship?
So is God really important, why do we worship?

Woke up in the morning not feeling good
A kiss from my love and I get better
When I'm down she smiles at me
I get goosebumps and I feel great again
My love, your conversations are passionate
My love, your conversations are hot
Oh my love, your conversations are really passionate
That's how she is, very humble
She doesn't want trouble; good things speak for themselves
My black beauty, true African beauty
When I idolize you, respond to it
Awww, my love
Oh love, I can barely sleep when you're not around
Oh when you're not around, I have nightmares
Oh when you're not around, I cry endlessly
My love, wrap your arms around my neck
And speak sweet melodies to make me feel better
My first love, your loving is so beautiful
You are one in a million
Awww, my love
When God created things, He created each man and his woman
If I've found my love, I will love her wholeheartedly
When she's coming from work, I will speed off to meet her
Then embrace her, come my love have a seat
Looking in your eyes gives me consolation
When I see you, I feel free
Awww, my love
Oh my love, I'm calling unto you
Oh love, I can barely sleep when you're not around
Oh when you're not around, I have nightmares
Oh when you're not around, I cry endlessly
I have sleepless nights when you're not around
I can barely sleep when my love is absent
I cry endlessly in my love's absence
I cry endlessly in my love's absence
I can barely sleep in my love's absence
I cry endlessly in my love's absence
I can barely sleep in my love's absence
I am crying endlessly when my love is not around
I am crying endlessly when my love is not around

I want to massage you from top to the toe
I'll massage the inside of your body
Your body will be very sweet to you (sweet sweet)
We'll find a place to hide
We'll find a corner, my lover and I
I'm ready to love as my lady wants
That one no stress, she wants to wine and dine with me
And after that she wants to pomp and grind with me
Grind with me
