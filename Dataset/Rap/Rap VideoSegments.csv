Ah!
When I came from my hometown to Accra
And I was pathetic
And my life looked bad
There was no hope but I couldn't go back
My paddy and I for some single room
And it was awful looking
Ha! I called my elder brother Kenneth, said he had nothing
Said he had started hustling staking lotto
And I wondered if I'll also stake lotto
And he laughed aha, something will do you like you're from Togo
Fast forward man got to hustle
I wanted to pursue music
I did rap battles
The life was hard
But no matter what I'll not go back to my hometown Kumasi Ejisu
That's the mind set
Poor no friend
So I stayed eye clear
I won't go agressively, I'll take my time
Blacko told you
So my God up there
I knelt down and begged him
That He should help me for my mum in the house was still calling me

Shower me all your blessings
Oh my God oh God eh If you don't come I'm dying oo
Yeah
If you give me life give me money
Any good health in this world I collect
I take it, I deserve it
If I get stuck in the mud
If my hope is finished
If my fears get to me, lay for me a bed
In the belly of the beast
Will never go on my knees
So father, I'm your seed
So if you've planted me
Then weed all the grasses that will affect my growth and speed
Aside all give me peace for I'm my family's hope

When I came from my hometown to Accra
And I was pathetic
And my life looked bad
There was no hope but I couldn't go back
My paddy and I for some single room
And it was awful looking
Ha! I called my elder brother Kenneth, said he had nothing
Said he had started hustling staking lotto
And I wondered if I'll also stake lotto
And he laughed aha, something will do you like you're from Togo
Fast forward man got to hustle
I wanted to pursue music
I did rap battles
The life was hard
But no matter what I'll not go back to my hometown Kumasi Ejisu
That's the mind set
Poor no friend
So I stayed eye clear
I won't go agressively, I'll take my time

If you give me life give me money
Any good health in this world I collect
I take it, I deserve it
If I get stuck in the mud
If my hope is finished
If my fears get to me, lay for me a bed
In the belly of the beast
Will never go on my knees
So father, I'm your seed
So if you've planted me
Then weed all the grasses that will affect my growth and speed
Aside all give me peace for I'm my family's hope

My light is on you always
In my bones I've not met a woman like you

If you get one sit by it
Come and hold me in haste (x2)
You're my star you always shine on me (x2)

See it has hurt you
If I didn't hide my love intentions from you would've spoilt it
It has hit him like the heat, my love and I will never separate
He has come from something and entered another
If I break her heart it'll be like breaking mine
If you had it wouldn't you like it the way
I love am I won't play with her love
And you that break your lover's heart
You that deceive others that you love them
If you usually bath it makes your face beautiful
If you get one stay by it waaa waaa waaa

It has hit him like the heat, my love and I will never separate
He has come from something and entered another
If I break her heart it'll be like breaking mine
If you had it wouldn't you like it the way
I love am I won't play with her love
And you that break your lover's heart
You that deceive others that you love them
If you usually bath it makes your face beautiful
If you get one stay by it waaa waaa waaa
You're like soap
As I've not rubbed you and you're like this then what will I do when you lather
You're not soap
I'll pamper you for your love to overwhelm me
You're not like soap 
I've not rubbed you and you're love has lathered and overwhelmed me

From the onset, all the previous love you've seen
It's concert, listen
Don't ever doubt love in your heart
In this power outage I won't ever let your light go off

Weeds of love, I tell you, I'll never finish weeding
I've set my eyes to the sky in trugh
I'll love you forever (x2)
So have hope and hold on to your faith
All times
And you will find out my love

You're my queen, I don't play with you my love
Eehhh oooo
I thank you my love
I'll look after you like a new born
And you'll laugh in your head
If you hear my name your sorrows will turn to laughter
Your will will be my priority
I'm with you all times because I want to protect you

Whoever disturbs you wants my fight
Father is here (x2) let me hit you eh
And let love triumph
I've opened my eyes
My light is on you always
In my bones I've not met a woman like you
Your stars are shining on me

If you get one sit by it
Come and hold me in haste (x2)
You're my star you always shine on me (x2)

Aunty Merie doesn't know that this be life I'm living here (Accra)

If I tell my old woman she'll stress oo
So I keep it all to myself (Me alone)
No one has sent me to be a gangster
It's my own choice, very firm (Stand tall)
So I'm aware of whatever I do (Ah ha)
Silence for a minute rest in peace to sister Mariam eh (RIP)
If God gives us healing
We'll meet up there one day
Then I'll tell you my story
That when you left us
I came to to Accra for trap (Trapping alone)
I'm doing so many bad things
But I don't mind because of money
I know you're in heaven so intercede for me
'Cause I really lose my way
This is not what I was taught
But if I don't do it
Maybe there'll be problems (x2)
So take me like that
For Kwaku Frimpong will bring problem oo (Problem will come oo) (x8)
Killer man will bring problem oo (x8)
Eh, Sark boys in the house (we've come)
If you're not part of us bounce (Go home)
We've invited you unannounced (Look)
Out of the blue we've come it's loud (Aren't you scared)
Quickly we've roll it tight
'Cause this world is fake (And we're smoking)
I'm laughing you think you want to fly
So I have plenty of the thing (Plenty)
If you've gone on a ride come home (Come home oo) (x2)
Come home for we're waiting for you (Amnesia) (x2)
A lot of this marijuana (We've strapped ahh'oo) (x2)
We can't spoil it alone (x2)

(Oh oh oh oh) ye ye ye ye, ye ye ye
(Stallion)
Niggas in the hood don't like plenty talking
I swear to God (eh I swear to God'oo oh)
The transaction is through a lot of money
Chairman has stepped on the money
So we've pulled up at his place (His house)
We and about 12 killer boys (Ahaa)
We've called him that we are in front
Right in front of the house come down (We're standing)
Aunty Merie doesn't know that this be life I'm living here (Accra)
Things I see with my eyes
If I tell my old woman she'll stress oo
So I keep it all to myself (Me alone)
No one has sent me to be a gangster
It's my own choice, very firm (Stand tall)
So I'm aware of whatever I do (Ah ha)
Silence for a minute rest in peace to sister Mariam eh (RIP)
If God gives us healing
We'll meet up there one day
Then I'll tell you my story
That when you left us
I came to to Accra for trap (Trapping alone)
I'm doing so many bad things
But I don't mind because of money
I know you're in heaven so intercede for me
'Cause I really lose my way
This is not what I was taught
But if I don't do it
Maybe there'll be problems (x2)
So take me like that
For Kwaku Frimpong will bring problem oo (Problem will come oo) (x8)
Killer man will bring problem oo (x8)
Eh, Sark boys in the house (we've come)
If you're not part of us bounce (Go home)
We've invited you unannounced (Look)
Out of the blue we've come it's loud (Aren't you scared)
Quickly we've roll it tight
'Cause this world is fake (And we're smoking)
I'm laughing you think you want to fly
So I have plenty of the thing (Plenty)
If you've gone on a ride come home (Come home oo) (x2)
Come home for we're waiting for you (Amnesia) (x2)
A lot of this marijuana (We've strapped ahh'oo) (x2)
We can't spoil it alone (x2)
Ye ye ye (ay) (x3)

Listen, for if you don't listen you'll listen
Don't fear, do as you wish for only you receive your salary
Everyone and their taste
You have your feelings I have mine
Leave me to my doings
Everyone and their taste
Whether you do it or not we'll talk focus and do what you want
Everyone and their taste
Others are fat others are slim leave them to thier doings
Everyone and their taste (x2)
What is your taste (x6)
Listen, for if you don't listen you'll listen
Fresh boys in the building
I want the difference between Zoomlion and Town Council
Who has gone to school and know Mathematics of trash
Just say one's scent is like tear gas
Sandals are very expensive so I'm using slippers
The pastor's church doesn't pay taxes
If the driver's mate doesn't understand English then not Away bus
When it comes to football I swear I dey play pass
Didn't Micheal Essien leave Chealsea for Ajax
It's his taste, run and be late
If you know that you hate
Make you no underrate, that me the ish
Force and get a wish
Fisherman catches fish to prepare his dish
Common tilapia is very expesive, if you use a car to pay then you start to think
If your food burns then it's not cooked
You use Nokia, I use Chinese
If the naked says he'll give you clothes listen to his name
Listen, which lizard grows hair
If someone wakes up, his mouth smell is like
What someone usually does is his lie
Remember if you do one he'll do five
The mouth of gossips are sharper than knife
Fresh boys in the building TM for life
If someone drinks his juice and blows fuse and you smell it I swear you'll be confused
Ebenezer Tettey Huse, we say he is cute
He makes everyone pay dues in parliament
But for me I refuse to be acute to give children drug abuse
Just to mention few for my crew and I
Fresh boys in the building be what we go choose
Happiness for the spot
A drunkard takes tot
Junkie takes a jot
If you steal something you go to court
Young girl has worn short dress
Yo yo doesn't like socks
You've gone to school to do a course to turn the boss of a foolish person
Mad man dey touch
Lights out wants torch
Fanta and malt, which one costs
you don't know because you are the boss of palm wine
It is his taste of course
Talkative is waiting for pause
If a child cries we give him breasts to play
But if a man holds it it removes
I'll talk in parables
Every white man's teeth is decayed
I take it back, if I don't say it well I'll get a slap
Rap is my sibling so he calls me big bro
If you talk a lot then it means you don't have money
If you brush your teeth, it can spoil your teeth
I'm using a tooth, I'm using a chewing stick, that's my new taste
I believe in instincts more than in reason
So do what pleases you

You have your feelings I have mine
Leave me to my doings
Everyone and their taste
Whether you do it or not we'll talk focus and do what you want
Everyone and their taste
Others are fat others are slim leave them to thier doings
Everyone and their taste (x2)
What is your taste (x6)
Listen, for if you don't listen you'll listen
Fresh boys in the building
I want the difference between Zoomlion and Town Council
Who has gone to school and know Mathematics of trash
Just say one's scent is like tear gas
Sandals are very expensive so I'm using slippers
The pastor's church doesn't pay taxes
If the driver's mate doesn't understand English then not Away bus
When it comes to football I swear I dey play pass
Didn't Micheal Essien leave Chealsea for Ajax
It's his taste, run and be late
If you know that you hate
Make you no underrate, that me the ish
Force and get a wish
Fisherman catches fish to prepare his dish
Common tilapia is very expesive, if you use a car to pay then you start to think
If your food burns then it's not cooked
You use Nokia, I use Chinese
If the naked says he'll give you clothes listen to his name
Listen, which lizard grows hair
If someone wakes up, his mouth smell is like
What someone usually does is his lie
Remember if you do one he'll do five
The mouth of gossips are sharper than knife
Fresh boys in the building TM for life
If someone drinks his juice and blows fuse and you smell it I swear you'll be confused
Ebenezer Tettey Huse, we say he is cute
He makes everyone pay dues in parliament
But for me I refuse to be acute to give children drug abuse
Just to mention few for my crew and I
Fresh boys in the building be what we go choose
Happiness for the spot
A drunkard takes tot
Junkie takes a jot
If you steal something you go to court
Young girl has worn short dress
Yo yo doesn't like socks
You've gone to school to do a course to turn the boss of a foolish person
Mad man dey touch
Lights out wants torch
Fanta and malt, which one costs
you don't know because you are the boss of palm wine
It is his taste of course
Talkative is waiting for pause
If a child cries we give him breasts to play
But if a man holds it it removes
I'll talk in parables
Every white man's teeth is decayed
I take it back, if I don't say it well I'll get a slap
Rap is my sibling so he calls me big bro
If you talk a lot then it means you don't have money
If you brush your teeth, it can spoil your teeth
I'm using a tooth, I'm using a chewing stick, that's my new taste
I believe in instincts more than in reason
So do what pleases you

Fante Van Damme from Takoradi to Prampram
If you knew I'll come you wouldn't have sent your regards
Last I saw you in Afram you were filled with pomade but you weren't massaged
Because of my clothes they want to sweep me away
The noise is a crowd but it hasn't touched
They increased in number now but they didn't meet me
They disturb me everyday but it doesn't get to me
Everyone knows that I won't live forever so even if I fool I'm up
Remove your underwear, I'll smoke and smoke you
Now, I'll take off your footwear and take off your socks
And take off your watch
The game is on the floor I'll take of my crocs
It's nothing new, I say it as it is
This is between you and me, no God is involved so no grace is involved
You've taken off your eyes sweetly, now the enemy hasn't gotten us
Because of the rain they don't come out (x2)
They smoke their heads off (x2)
Takoradi executioner I say have my sympathy (x2)
I choke them so they should jump (x2)
I was reaching for a gun de other day
Cos the demons said they wasnt gonna spray
Come again na
Come again na
This de Luda Mary J you'd run away na
Try me there is lyrics in my circle
Bitches i can hit u with a feather weight
Preach, next thing you casket closed funeral service
I done been to hell and back again
If you biz me i go tell you oh it was a mile away
Niggas thought we shadin hope in for a brighter day
I've been fighting with the mighties hoping for a lighter weight
Side, imma be fine
Am i gon be fine? if i killed the vibe
Cos lately you niggas living life truth nigga im poof now you decide who the real is
Here we go ooo ooh ooh
Here we go ooo ooh ooh",Rap,I'll be in all black. The artiste dares anyone to come up to him and he'll be in all black. Even if the person wants to take it to the grave he is ready and he'll be in all black. He further assumes his role as a Takoradi executioner who is not afraid of anything and is ready to go the extremes. Further hardened by drugs he has no fear for anyone.

Fante Van Damme from Takoradi to Prampram
If you knew I'll come you wouldn't have sent your regards
Last I saw you in Afram you were filled with pomade but you weren't massaged
Because of my clothes they want to sweep me away
The noise is a crowd but it hasn't touched
They increased in number now but they didn't meet me
They disturb me everyday but it doesn't get to me
Everyone knows that I won't live forever so even if I fool I'm up
Remove your underwear, I'll smoke and smoke you
Now, I'll take off your footwear and take off your socks
And take off your watch
The game is on the floor I'll take of my crocs
It's nothing new, I say it as it is
This is between you and me, no God is involved so no grace is involved
You've taken off your eyes sweetly, now the enemy hasn't gotten us
Because of the rain they don't come out (x2)
They smoke their heads off (x2)
Takoradi executioner I say have my sympathy (x2)
I choke them so they should jump (x2)
I was reaching for a gun de other day
Cos the demons said they wasnt gonna spray
Come again na
Come again na
This de Luda Mary J you'd run away na
Try me there is lyrics in my circle
Bitches i can hit u with a feather weight
Preach, next thing you casket closed funeral service
I done been to hell and back again
If you biz me i go tell you oh it was a mile away
Niggas thought we shadin hope in for a brighter day
I've been fighting with the mighties hoping for a lighter weight
Side, imma be fine
Am i gon be fine? if i killed the vibe
Cos lately you niggas living life truth nigga im poof now you decide who the real is
Here we go ooo ooh ooh
Here we go ooo ooh ooh",Rap,I'll be in all black. The artiste dares anyone to come up to him and he'll be in all black. Even if the person wants to take it to the grave he is ready and he'll be in all black. He further assumes his role as a Takoradi executioner who is not afraid of anything and is ready to go the extremes. Further hardened by drugs he has no fear for anyone.

Here we go ooo ooh ooh",Rap,I'll be in all black. The artiste dares anyone to come up to him and he'll be in all black. Even if the person wants to take it to the grave he is ready and he'll be in all black. He further assumes his role as a Takoradi executioner who is not afraid of anything and is ready to go the extremes. Further hardened by drugs he has no fear for anyone.

You feeling the wave
You know what is coming (x2)
When a thousand leave a thousand will come (x2)
Show me who is a man
You feeling the wave
This is the birth of a new era
Call the king for a sack letter
We taking the game to a different dimension so forget your dripping
Gone are the days when women weren't worthy
You don't let us talk in public
Y'all be sleeping on women for too long
Still my eyes were shut
If you're asleep wake up cause I give love to the game
It took a woman to change this world with just an apple so behave
Rappers who are not yet eloquent
Come and suck from my breasts (x2)
Y'all sound like babies
What the men couldn't do
Since I came I've done it
Come close erh
When I became active then you cry
Look for a rapper to shut me down erh
Or there's no one
Maybe that's why I'm spoilt than turkey
They don't understand why a gal could do this
Strip me naked and see what I have
Cause I came and I saw and I conquered 
Strong foundation 
I didn't use concrete
I dey enter everyday
I don't read road sign so I have a court case everyday
Yo I get the bars in me
Yes I get the tag in me
Yes I get a big DAJ
Am back in me
At first you were doubting me
Now bow to the rap king of Africa
Show me who is a man (x8)
Goddess of rap
I haven't given birth before
None of you is Jesus
We compare you and I bar for bar
You're lurking in the corner you want to cry
What's inside is what's uncovered
If you don't understand then cross Densu river
The run I'm coming with is intense
Even if you've gone to Benin and back 
It won't work
A youth whose bars gives you tension
Fresh blood I won't look at pension
My mouth stings as the bee's
On the beat I'm the beast
It's not my ass that I'll show for attention
Cause young gals look up to me
To lead them to win
That's what has made me angry
No be say Eno Barony is mean
They said its a man's world but I entered without a passport
When it comes torap I am a gang
Forget I've hacked your password
I be bisexual in the game
I just dey fuck dem up
Whether gals or boys
Whether gals or boys
If you like put the game on board
I'll turn myself into a pussy to crush your balls
From the slums I made it up
It's onlly right I get my crown
You who downplay my success
You're as a condom used for four rounds
You've now seen my quality
I started with a lot but check my longeity
Now you know why I say God is a woman
Now back to the rap queen of Africa


",Rap,Show me who is a man. A very bold and daring song. This song tells of the singers domination in the rap music. She tells of how she came from nowhere and has made it in the rap music. She further tells of her inspiration to other females in the industry as well as upcoming artiste.

You feeling the wave
You know what is coming (x2)
When a thousand leave a thousand will come (x2)
Show me who is a man
You feeling the wave
This is the birth of a new era
Call the king for a sack letter
We taking the game to a different dimension so forget your dripping
Gone are the days when women weren't worthy
You don't let us talk in public
Y'all be sleeping on women for too long
Still my eyes were shut
If you're asleep wake up cause I give love to the game
It took a woman to change this world with just an apple so behave
Rappers who are not yet eloquent
Come and suck from my breasts (x2)
Y'all sound like babies
What the men couldn't do
Since I came I've done it
Come close erh
When I became active then you cry
Look for a rapper to shut me down erh
Or there's no one
Maybe that's why I'm spoilt than turkey
They don't understand why a gal could do this
Strip me naked and see what I have
Cause I came and I saw and I conquered 
Strong foundation 
I didn't use concrete
I dey enter everyday
I don't read road sign so I have a court case everyday
Yo I get the bars in me
Yes I get the tag in me
Yes I get a big DAJ
Am back in me
At first you were doubting me
Now bow to the rap king of Africa
Show me who is a man (x8)
Goddess of rap
I haven't given birth before
None of you is Jesus
We compare you and I bar for bar
You're lurking in the corner you want to cry
What's inside is what's uncovered
If you don't understand then cross Densu river
The run I'm coming with is intense
Even if you've gone to Benin and back 
It won't work
A youth whose bars gives you tension
Fresh blood I won't look at pension
My mouth stings as the bee's
On the beat I'm the beast
It's not my ass that I'll show for attention
Cause young gals look up to me
To lead them to win
That's what has made me angry
No be say Eno Barony is mean
They said its a man's world but I entered without a passport
When it comes torap I am a gang
Forget I've hacked your password
I be bisexual in the game
I just dey fuck dem up
Whether gals or boys
Whether gals or boys
If you like put the game on board
I'll turn myself into a pussy to crush your balls
From the slums I made it up
It's onlly right I get my crown
You who downplay my success
You're as a condom used for four rounds
You've now seen my quality
I started with a lot but check my longeity
Now you know why I say God is a woman
Now back to the rap queen of Africa

Someone should tell my love that I'm taken (x4)
Eno Adwoa someone's beauty like me aaa (x2)
I won't let one love kill me for thousands to mourn (x2)
When I met him it was night
By morning it was too late
I took him like that for us to date
He wants to give me broken heart Duba Shege
You're kidding
It thought I'll cry and and beg
I've ignored even the Benz driver
Then you who uses Huawei phone
What you buy for the girls I can buy for myself
I don't have the time to date undeserved
A man whose pictures hang in your room like a saloon
Your beard like a goat
What doesn't kill me makes me strong
If you don't want then love is not by force
Men are plenty bossu close your window (let me go)
For someone is knocking on my door
It's King Paluta yieeee
I say if you leave me today (x2)
Someone will take me (x2)
And kill me with true love (x2)
Look
I'm deafened by love myself
Yie yiee yieeee
I know it's timed
Whatever you want do with me
God will reveal, Someone who will love me ooo",Rap,Someone should tell my love (my ex) that I am already taken. This song tells of the abundance of suitors in this world and how irrespective of the pain and sorrow from one's heartbreak they can move on to find even better lovers who will care and cherish them more than their ex did.

When I send you a lot
It's not like I am lazy
My queen you're back is very beautiful to me
Or if I crack a joke and you laugh
It's not like I am happy
My queen your laughter is beautiful to me like gap teeth
Girl you blow my mind people say it's Juju
'Cause I think about you all the time and all the things you do
Girl you make I dey weak oh
You make I weak oh

There it is oh (x4)
The day my love comes then my sorrows disappear
There it is (x2)
The day my love comes the bed talks
If it's because of her that you've rented a car
Master park for it won't work
You've given her money to say I love you
Man stop she won't say it
You've used your last to book Golden Tulip
Look, she is at my place she won't come
Even if I go out and I'm not yet home
Whatever you do she won't sleep
She doesn't see none of them
She's on my chest
Even in a hut
She no give a damm
She wouldn't let you discourage her
You talk of me everyday she gives me vim
Her love is in my heart
Your love is peacefully on the ground
Like anything on the ground
So I will take it and polish it nicely
For it to end in marriage
Tete Quashie you're my cocoa
You're more valuable than gold
I'd be a fool to disturb you
I won't let you go sad
If you are not with me I feel so cold
I've taken Procold but to no avail
I'll take money and do you show
You go blow control
Don't fear you be Mrs flow ooooh
Ebe you make I rise up
You make I rise up
You be my light born
Without you, I have no lights0
Spice up my life

Even if I go out and I'm not yet home
Whatever you do she won't sleep
She doesn't see none of them
She's on my chest
Even in a hut
She no give a damm
She wouldn't let you discourage her
You talk of me everyday she gives me vim
Her love is in my heart
Your love is peacefully on the ground
Like anything on the ground
So I will take it and polish it nicely
For it to end in marriage
Tete Quashie you're my cocoa
You're more valuable than gold
I'd be a fool to disturb you
I won't let you go sad
If you are not with me I feel so cold
I've taken Procold but to no avail
I'll take money and do you show
You go blow control
Don't fear you be Mrs flow ooooh
Ebe you make I rise up
You make I rise up
You be my light born
Without you, I have no lights0
Spice up my life
Why I go dey lie yo

We say he is arrogant
He's living his life in sorrow
One day his star will shine
Family, as Agyekum is not dead and you're mourning him
But if he was wealthy you would have crowned him king
Because his life is not going on well
When he passes then you hold your noses
As for me I'm touched
Whatever he says I've accepted
He hasn't given me anything but when he brought me a platter
I didn't cast it away
Now to my niggas on the block, you know what time it is
I've waken up at dawn with tiring menial work
Still and stagnat water, and it's struggles
Poverty has made me travell badly, when they meet in the forest they speak of me
You would have seen that we the travellers, are really suffering
When my mother birthed me on the mat, I couldn't cry

You would have seen that we the travellers, are really suffering
When my mother birthed me on the mat, I couldn't cry
It was later when I cried, because this world is filled with sorrow

Whatever he says I've accepted
He hasn't given me anything but when he brought me a platter
I didn't cast it away
Now to my niggas on the block, you know what time it is
I've waken up at dawn with tiring menial work
Still and stagnat water, and it's struggles
Poverty has made me travell badly, when they meet in the forest they speak of me
You would have seen that we the travellers, are really suffering
When my mother birthed me on the mat, I couldn't cry
It was later when I cried, because this world is filled with sorrow
But whether we like it or not we're already in this world
If we didn't come to this world we wouldn't have known it's problems

I've gotten my money
You can't tell me nothing

If you get something
Use some to buy a car
To fix wufa
And play my sound

We them boys juice paper chases
Get in the ride we keeping a hundred, we keeping a hundred
You're not a hustler Baba so shut your mouth
Who is talking to me about hand to mouth
I've kept a wake over night, for more than a month
A month a client has sent a little I'll pop ruff
If you wake up in the morning 
Then chant prayers
If you take off your clothes then you turn up your speakers

Go and sip they owe you and wear your shorts
Open your speakers and play my style 
Katiboom
If you succeed in Ghana then everyone will talk
The pot concerns you the Kutu is pot
I'm like Papa Nii my case is in court
Let me happy myself Oga life is short
If he has gotten hate for me then he has lost
I'm hit in Amakom for them to shock
If you spoil my money and have not Jesus you have lost

Boys who always want, single
If you get Becca take

You dey took a big clause
But I still floss
If some hits your girlfriend and I search for a lip gloss
He say make I cool down with the pressure

This year God will make you big like a big boss like Kwaw

Open your speakers and play my style

If you succeed in Ghana then everyone will talk

If he has gotten hate for me then he has lost
I'm hit in Amakom for them to shock
If you spoil my money and have not Jesus you have lost

I know the Rap Pastor but I don't know a pastor
Wherever you go go and ask I hate wisdom like Kwaw
Action
If you get there absence 
Mention my name for me, no don't mention it I'll mention it myself
MDK, you hear
Swear poof wow
Sowutuom boy I'm a sniper spitting poisonous by heart viper
You're past stupid or for them they're Cupa, Piper
Nursery things take it as a diaper
Katiboom
If you hate it's your own choice
If you stream it's your own voice
Ano be your mate
If you look me do I have coins 
Kick for baseline you dey fill am
Katiboom
You dey feel am
Maybe you have kenkey it's left with fried fish
Boys who always want, single
If you get Becca take
We're coming to rub you like an Owl
Go and ask of me from Racecourse
I'm a big boss
You dey took a big clause
But I still floss
If some hits your girlfriend and I search for a lip gloss
He say make I cool down with the pressure
But I still force
This year God will make you big like a big boss like Kwaw
Shoutouts to the big boys

Killer Boobo
Open open for if you won't listen you'll listen
If you look and it hits aa for the poppin (x3)
For the for the poppin (x3)
If the thing hits you aa for the bouncing (x3)
For the for the bouncing (x3)
This year they say I'm in Bankok
This year they say I'm long talk
This year if you miss me aaa I'm in Hong Kong
This year if you see me aa I'm James Bond
My son he says Daddy, I want puff puff
He says if Daddy I hit you, give me a response
If I'm like that I go for long talk
If I go and come back I take K)nsh)n
My God who gives me response when he picks me
He says if I worhip him he'll make me strong
Sometimes if you pick me I'll play Rick Ross
When we wear and it's dirty, it goes to dispose
This year we're in Haiti
So they are haiting
Whatever they say for debating
My great covenant fornication
I'm as small as a pin 
So if you sit on me you'll shout
Look and you don't go and roam that you want my prescription
You'll go to jail
Your mustache like sponge
You need Apo
I'm slim but in rap I'm built
Try me and buy
You didn't look sharp for I've surpassed you
I rep the streets ghetto youth
I don't like champagne 
I'll buy juice
You don't know anything Lacto Juice
We draw for you like
Kwaw and I we've dropped a lot so we don't have a problem
We will murder you
I'm not like that but I'll butcher you
This year aftewards then I'll walk in town
Kro kyia, I don't fear the day
If you want lucky look at Drogba
My folder
Oh naa, my rap shows my profile
Brokedown, my knockdown
My mind is more than memory lowdown
To down
I won't be afraid, so so so always
I dey feel your teeth, cos my favorite colour is yellow
You dey talk this for my back but if you see me hello
When we start for talk all the other boys the mellow
So if you see and it hits then come follow
They say I'm a hawk, I'm a hawk hawk
They say I'm tough I'm a Bonton
They say I dey cause, I'm Kwaw long
Kwaw is on 
If it hits, Kwaw song
They say this year I'm at Jupiter
I'm Lucifer
Kwaw the top ranger
They say today I'm a pharmaceutical
I'll give you a bad medicine and that one is critical
They say this year I celebrate Homowo, I celebrate Akwamu and Hogbetsotso
They say this year I'm promising
Everything I do, I'll do it Alo

You dey talk this for my back but if you see me hello
When we start for talk all the other boys the mellow
So if you see and it hits then come follow
They say I'm a hawk, I'm a hawk hawk
They say I'm tough I'm a Bonton
They say I dey cause, I'm Kwaw long
Kwaw is on 
If it hits, Kwaw song
They say this year I'm at Jupiter
I'm Lucifer
Kwaw the top ranger
They say today I'm a pharmaceutical
I'll give you a bad medicine and that one is critical
They say this year I celebrate Homowo, I celebrate Akwamu and Hogbetsotso
They say this year I'm promising
Everything I do, I'll do it Alo

This year they say I'm in Bankok
This year they say I'm long talk
This year if you miss me aaa I'm in Hong Kong
This year if you see me aa I'm James Bond
My son he says Daddy, I want puff puff
He says if Daddy I hit you, give me a response
If I'm like that I go for long talk
If I go and come back I take K)nsh)n
My God who gives me response when he picks me
He says if I worhip him he'll make me strong
Sometimes if you pick me I'll play Rick Ross
When we wear and it's dirty, it goes to dispose
This year we're in Haiti
So they are haiting
Whatever they say for debating
My great covenant fornication
I'm as small as a pin 
So if you sit on me you'll shout
Look and you don't go and roam that you want my prescription
You'll go to jail
Your mustache like sponge
You need Apo
I'm slim but in rap I'm built
Try me and buy
You didn't look sharp for I've surpassed you
I rep the streets ghetto youth
I don't like champagne 
I'll buy juice
You don't know anything Lacto Juice
We draw for you like
Kwaw and I we've dropped a lot so we don't have a problem
We will murder you
I'm not like that but I'll butcher you
This year aftewards then I'll walk in town
Kro kyia, I don't fear the day
If you want lucky look at Drogba
My folder
Oh naa, my rap shows my profile
Brokedown, my knockdown
My mind is more than memory lowdown
To down
I won't be afraid, so so so always
I dey feel your teeth, cos my favorite colour is yellow
You dey talk this for my back but if you see me hello
When we start for talk all the other boys the mellow
So if you see and it hits then come follow
They say I'm a hawk, I'm a hawk hawk
They say I'm tough I'm a Bonton
They say I dey cause, I'm Kwaw long
Kwaw is on 
If it hits, Kwaw song
They say this year I'm at Jupiter
I'm Lucifer
Kwaw the top ranger
They say today I'm a pharmaceutical
I'll give you a bad medicine and that one is critical
They say this year I celebrate Homowo, I celebrate Akwamu and Hogbetsotso
They say this year I'm promising
Everything I do, I'll do it Alo

Swedru Agona (x3)
Yh
Last two
I will use my gari to eat Delay Mackerel
If you come home I'll make buffet
If it's beamer dear then I'll sleep Kupe
Today you are lucky Dube Lucky Dube
I would've done something to you today
Ato calls Kwaku Delay
For today I'll sow Kopee
This is not a circus
Tsikata's craves fillet
He is happy that he's won a case
He and Gloria Akuffo have booked a date
Where are they going
I have given him a fork it's left with plate
And a crate of beer
If you come from in-law I'll play Godey
If you play Melega aa I'll play cafe
If you are Takashi aa then away
This is Abodam for taste
Swedru Agona (x3)
I'm conquering with vhim
Swedru Agona (x3)
I'm conquering with strength
Let him turn on his light
Swedru Agona (x3)
You know that thing
Are you ready
I have taken the mike
If I spark the rap aaa
I'll show you that I am versatile, my style cuts across
I'll give you a gap but I'll still overtake you like tie a catapult
If you try me it'll turn bloody Spartacus
Brother no matter how crazy you are you won't reach my master Kow
Half of the brain is spoilt so it always has a plaster
Cape Coast and all of Agona Swedru has been scattered by us
Rapper shatta who has come
I've changed there
What I'm bringing
I'm bringing very good rap
He says it's sick but when he panicks when he sees me 
I'm Drogba
We have different levels
We can strike for defendables
We have money so everyday we leave Wuley
You booze on weekends
It's appetizing C. K.

If you're blowman then I'm last killer
You won't see me me too I be John Cena
Enough of the chit chat eat that pussy like a Kit Kat
It burns, it itches
Chairman for today, I'm owing, if you don't have money
Then it's left with you and fights
Even if I don't have talents then not my grind
Gossip, he's listening to go and report
If the game will be great it comes from the morning
If you don't have anything then go and sleep
I'm chilling I'm freezing I'm not typing I'm reading
I don't hit too I'm sneezing
Boy too fast I don't eat
Even if we tell you you won't believe it
If you girl doesn't click I'm feeling
The flier will be great on social media
I'm still not Tweeting
What be the chorus
Grrr grrr grrr grrr pawww (x4)
My brother de hustle ein brother
I no go fi bother (I no go fi bother my nigga)
Another wahala de come
So I'm counting my dollar (I'm counting my dollar)
You say we be family (You say we be family)
We go dey together (We go dey together)
The murder that murdered my mother
I murdered your mother (Swag)
If you pass there we go pass here
Don't curse me with wood use metal
Draw close to me o my dear
I'll jump like a grass cutter
I'm serious a young man
Look at his laughter and walk
He says if I'll spoil there aa, I should go mtcheeew
Spend money like normally (Gegee)
I de Rome pass Italy (Agyei agyei)
Actually, the swag bangs like tatale
Dstv, no get dish
I'm a chef, be my bitch
If you don't understand aa, hop in my acquarium
You're a fish
Freeze, ice, Jesus Christ
Sneakers, nice, cheques, Nike
IG, likes, swag, vibes
Saucy, yikes
I'm too jollof for your rice

Grrr grrr grrr grrr pawww (x4)",Rap,"This song tells of the riches and wealth of the singer. He also mentions of the different things he does, include travelling, and spending."

Children in this country we say have patience and humility
Obedience and respect and bow
The Bible tells to honour your father
That your days may be long on this earth
So be humble
Ghana is for you and me
For if we come together then it'll prosper
Almighty God alcohol, yao (x2)
Heaven and earthly Yaa, alcohol, yao (x2)
Great ancestors alcohol, yao (x2)
We pour libations for Kwame Nkrumah (x2)
Eeehhhh (x2)
Where are you, stand aside, another should come close
I stand here for Ghana
I call Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah
We call your name, you are mighty
You freed Ghana with your wisdom and became king
The atmosphere was quiet, the white was shaken at heart
Because they saw that your courage was great as hair
Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, your wisdom is like the stars
In all Africa we accept that you are knowledgeable
Mighty child, you're enlightened, Osabarima
You're enlightened like the dove
Your grace and gace has given Ghana freedom
All the people's of the world make ear and listen
Brekete, African rise
Brekete, royal rise
Brekete, Ashanti rise
Brekete, Fante rise (Eeeee eh!)
Brekete, Ewe rise
Brekete, Kwahuman rise
Hausa, Akuapem, Akyem, Bono, Dagomba, Ga
All Ghanaians (Ghanaians eh!)
Now I pour libation
Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nrumah, come for alcohol
Founding fathers who lay down your lives to free Ghana, we pour libation
We call you and all ancestors of all Ghanaians to come for alcohol
If you stand behind us, we plead to let love die
The evil one that left to him alone
Ghana will be disgraced
Let it be on their head
On Ghana's life
On the president's life
Obrafour on my life
Traditional path, let's go
Almighty God alcohol, yao (x4)
Heaven and earthly Yaa, alcohol, yao (x4)
Great ancestors alcohol, yao (x4)
We pour libations for Kwame Nkrumah (x4)
Eeehhhh (x4)",Rap,"Kwame Nkrumah, this song celebrates him as well as the founding fathers of Ghana. He pours libation for him and gives him appelation. He tells of his exploits and how he brought fear to the hearts of the oppresor. He also asks of the current citizen of what they have done and admonishes them to contribute to the development of the nation."

My love Moesha I miss you a lot
God help me let the new day meet me
If I hear your name then I'm shaking
We've broken up longtime ago
Still can’t believe why I let you go!
It was a mistake but now I know
I've let my love go already
I've acted foolishly and regret it oo
Now I know your love was so divine
Wish I go fit reverse the hand of time
Don’t know what to do to bring you back
I still got love for you that’s the fact
And your memories will always be cherished
Your love keep hunting me (Hunting me)
I will forever remember the good time
The way you handle me (handle me)
We've broken up
But my eyes are still after you
When I remember some of your doings
Then my eyes tear
If I come to your mind

Moesha Mosesha I've missed your conversations my love
Moesha Moesha I love you bring back the flavour
Tell me what I go do to win you back (x2) oo
And I go do anything it takes to revive your love
I've seen that I didn't act well
So my love eey
Ask my love to forgive me
I've regretted what I did so he should look at me
My lust has served me right
None of my other lovers loved me
I said myself that I've broken up with you
But due to what I've seen with my eyes I've changed my mind
In the night when I remember
The sweet talks I had with you your heart is mine
If not for you I've not worked before
The girl has the heart to wait
I had nothing but you didn't judge me
I miss waking up to find you lying by my side
So Moesha if you hear my voice
And no one's hand is on you
If you still have my love in your heart
Then do well and come and give me a kiss

The way you handle me (handle me)
We've broken up
But my eyes are still after you
When I remember some of your doings
Then my eyes tear
If I come to your mind
Don't hesitate beauty
My old love ooo call me on the mobile phone eer
Let's talk about ourseves (x2)
Let me just hear your voice (x2)
This evening call me on the mobile phone eer (x2)
Moesha Mosesha I've missed your conversations my love
Moesha Moesha I love you bring back the flavour
Tell me what I go do to win you back (x2) oo
And I go do anything it takes to revive your love
I've seen that I didn't act well
So my love eey
Ask my love to forgive me
I've regretted what I did so he should look at me
My lust has served me right
None of my other lovers loved me
I said myself that I've broken up with you
But due to what I've seen with my eyes I've changed my mind
In the night when I remember
The sweet talks I had with you your heart is mine
If not for you I've not worked before
The girl has the heart to wait
I had nothing but you didn't judge me
I miss waking up to find you lying by my side
So Moesha if you hear my voice
And no one's hand is on you
If you still have my love in your heart
Then do well and come and give me a kiss
For I am not far my only world",Rap,This song tells of the singer's ex Moesha. He tells of the mistake he did in letting her go and how he regrets what he did. He tells of how he misses her and asks her to come back to her.

We've broken up longtime ago
Still can’t believe why I let you go!

I've let my love go already

Baby lemme prepare your heart

Love doctor I've come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Commot all the advice you get from peers
Many many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make I know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice my love you dey shiver
I go protect your heart make you be my diva
I'll stay single than to take you and leave
Baby girl ah you come first (x2)
I’ll be here to lay your bed (x2)
Try and leave me, I'll cry for my tears to finish (x2)
Forget it's you that I need my love
Be my baby mama
It's in your mind that one day I'll betray you
Queen Afia Kobi's grandchild
If you give me your heart I'll really love you
You've dated Kumasi and Amaransa
You've carried water and wine
Kwadwo and Kofi and not the same wine
So agree for one day I'll marry you
Kina dɛ daadi kina dɛ kew
The girls are plenty but it's you I want
The way I'm happy it's you I see
The numerous men coming to you I'm the one who loves you
Follow your heart make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance later you give me the praise
My love give me the chance to relieve pains
We mourn still you're great
Baby girl ah you come first
I’ll be here to lay your bed
Lemme show you something
I’m a Rockstar e no be long thing
It's not like I talk but my pocket has nothing
I mean I know the reason why I’m confronting
All my love wants is my sweet talk
When I’m with you I see it all hoilday

You've dated Kumasi and Amaransa
You've carried water and wine
Kwadwo and Kofi and not the same wine
So agree for one day I'll marry you
Kina dɛ daadi kina dɛ kew
The girls are plenty but it's you I want
The way I'm happy it's you I see
The numerous men coming to you I'm the one who loves you
Follow your heart make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance later you give me the praise
My love give me the chance to relieve pains
We mourn still you're great
Baby girl ah you come first
I’ll be here to lay your bed
Lemme show you something

Morning star I'm getting famous
Shine like a star, I was weaned with rap
I'm outspoken, Chairman flow breaks heart
I've put the rap on fire I've roasting it like an eagle
A letter to the whack rappers up for debate
I'm lifting the brand, so the bars elevate
It's not my match anyday day, I have what it takes
One day we'll celebrate my public holiday
Flow, but rap is under my belt
My mouth is sharp so think before you touch me
Chaley, I'm grown with rap enemies flow and blowing their nose
So many lines with so many rhymes
So many tried, and so many died
I've heard this rap, so many times
These set of rappers, I'm so undefined
Always in the T-Shirt, but flow is in my jeans
I've moved forward, paddy, I can see your pains
Started rapping when the Denmarks were the Danes
I don't brag, but my flow is more than your kings
I've gathered rap, the flow, it's not easy
I'm murdering bars, go oo for I have come
The timing is great so the my song has touched your heart
Kwaku, the rap is hotter than summer-summer
Your goats can't make me run, I'm your herdsman
Forget the 'wording', I'm the best man in rap
I keep appearing in your dreams, I'm your nightmare
I stopped crying when I realised awards don't pay rent
No matter how the Tico speeds the Benz sees it as timid
If you try me, like someone from Finland, you are 'finished'
Denswag, drop every beat for we go kill it
I'm afraid of my destroyers, Kwaku Sei I don't play
All of us will pass away but my words are like music
If you had eyes you'll see that curses are different
Regardless, I still made it with the crazy way
Party time every day, so I don't see holidays
Me? To fear Ghanaian rappers 
It's funny like fish a looking for an umbrella on a rainy day
Due to the weight of the puch, me, I don't take body guards
VIP owner, I don't have anything, I have bars
Papa Rasta, I have dough you say I have pass
If man created the world then some will pee gas
If it was left to my enemies I'll always be a sad man

All of us will pass away but my words are like music
If you had eyes you'll see that curses are different
Regardless, I still made it with the crazy way
Party time every day, so I don't see holidays
Me? To fear Ghanaian rappers 
It's funny like fish a looking for an umbrella on a rainy day
Due to the weight of the puch, me, I don't take body guards
VIP owner, I don't have anything, I have bars
Papa Rasta, I have dough you say I have pass
If man created the world then some will pee gas
If it was left to my enemies I'll always be a sad man
Me, I don't smoke or drink but I'm a bad man
Uh! If you'll brink beef I don't want a soft one
When I buy beef I want a hard one
I stopped crying when I found out that awards don't pay rent",Rap,"In this song, the rapper tells of how great his rap is. And how good he is compared to other rappers."
468,Segment_11_Strongman - Last Verse.mp4,Strongman - Last Verse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odaIrIHkFlU,MP4,Twi,Positive," Yeah, You say!
Uh, have you head
Hey! Yeah (Tubhani Muzik)
Morning star I'm getting famous
Shine like a star, I was weaned with rap
I'm outspoken, Chairman flow breaks heart
I've put the rap on fire I've roasting it like an eagle
A letter to the whack rappers up for debate
I'm lifting the brand, so the bars elevate
It's not my match anyday day, I have what it takes
One day we'll celebrate my public holiday
Flow, but rap is under my belt
My mouth is sharp so think before you touch me
Chaley, I'm grown with rap enemies flow and blowing their nose
So many lines with so many rhymes
So many tried, and so many died
I've heard this rap, so many times
These set of rappers, I'm so undefined
Always in the T-Shirt, but flow is in my jeans
I've moved forward, paddy, I can see your pains
Started rapping when the Denmarks were the Danes
I don't brag, but my flow is more than your kings
I've gathered rap, the flow, it's not easy
I'm murdering bars, go oo for I have come
The timing is great so the my song has touched your heart
Kwaku, the rap is hotter than summer-summer
Your goats can't make me run, I'm your herdsman
Forget the 'wording', I'm the best man in rap
I keep appearing in your dreams, I'm your nightmare
I stopped crying when I realised awards don't pay rent
No matter how the Tico speeds the Benz sees it as timid
If you try me, like someone from Finland, you are 'finished'
Denswag, drop every beat for we go kill it
I'm afraid of my destroyers, Kwaku Sei I don't play
All of us will pass away but my words are like music
If you had eyes you'll see that curses are different
Regardless, I still made it with the crazy way
Party time every day, so I don't see holidays
Me? To fear Ghanaian rappers 
It's funny like fish a looking for an umbrella on a rainy day
Due to the weight of the puch, me, I don't take body guards
VIP owner, I don't have anything, I have bars
Papa Rasta, I have dough you say I have pass
If man created the world then some will pee gas
If it was left to my enemies I'll always be a sad man
Me, I don't smoke or drink but I'm a bad man
Uh! If you'll brink beef I don't want a soft one
