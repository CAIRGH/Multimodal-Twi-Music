Give God praises
Then I go get that money
Like play like play we're growing
I don't talk much cool gee
I usually don't mind stupidity
Empty barrels make noise
I live my live on a low key
I usually don't talk (x2)
Money doesn't like noise (x2)
Good beads don't talk much beauty doesn't like noise (x2)
I'm here do with me as you please (x2)
I've brought myself (x2)
Here is the issue keep on talking (x2)
He who hasn't sinned before (x2)
Oh yoo ii
Whether good or bad I praise my God
Put your foolishness somewhere
For I'm busy making money
I don't waste time I don't have time for foolishness
If I waste my time in a few years time
If I don't make serious and make it
My grown up days
You're the same ones to laugh at me that I don't have anything
That's why I'm working like a mad man
As you were blessing your kids I was the last one
The last one
But Paul who came late but is better than the forebearers
Yeyeye
Listen to me (x2)
If you like dig a grave and bury me (x2)
I'm still bounce back don't dare me (x2)
He who has ears let him hear (x2)
Oh yoo ii",Rap,This song tells of the firm resolve of the hustler. They give praise to God and work on themselves and making it. They do not mind the crowd or what others are saying and they push to make it no matter the odds against time.,Positive,1.5143661,0.41232693,6.939278e-05,0.05355299864891914,"[-152.00243     146.51851      -1.2126117    33.067146     -8.784284

So we've pulled up at his place (His house)

We've called him that we are in front

Quickly we've roll it tight
'Cause this world is fake (And we're smoking)
I'm laughing you think you want to fly
So I have plenty of the thing (Plenty)
If you've gone on a ride come home (Come home oo) (x2)
Come home for we're waiting for you (Amnesia) (x2)

We've called him that we are in front

I came to to Accra for trap (Trapping alone)
I'm doing so many bad things

I know you're in heaven so intercede for me
'Cause I really lose my way
This is not what I was taught
But if I don't do it
Maybe there'll be problems (x2)

We've invited you unannounced (Look)
Out of the blue we've come it's loud (Aren't you scared)
Quickly we've roll it tight
'Cause this world is fake (And we're smoking)
I'm laughing you think you want to fly
So I have plenty of the thing (Plenty)
If you've gone on a ride come home (Come home oo) (x2)
Come home for we're waiting for you (Amnesia) (x2)

Listen, for if you don't listen you'll listen

Just say one's scent is like tear gas
Sandals are very expensive so I'm using slippers
The pastor's church doesn't pay taxes
If the driver's mate doesn't understand English then not Away bus
When it comes to football I swear I dey play pass
Didn't Micheal Essien leave Chealsea for Ajax
It's his taste, run and be late
If you know that you hate
Make you no underrate, that me the ish
Force and get a wish
Fisherman catches fish to prepare his dish
Common tilapia is very expesive, if you use a car to pay then you start to think
If your food burns then it's not cooked
You use Nokia, I use Chinese
If the naked says he'll give you clothes listen to his name
Listen, which lizard grows hair
If someone wakes up, his mouth smell is like
What someone usually does is his lie
Remember if you do one he'll do five
The mouth of gossips are sharper than knife
Fresh boys in the building TM for life
If someone drinks his juice and blows fuse and you smell it I swear you'll be confused
Ebenezer Tettey Huse, we say he is cute
He makes everyone pay dues in parliament
But for me I refuse to be acute to give children drug abuse
Just to mention few for my crew and I
Fresh boys in the building be what we go choose
Happiness for the spot
A drunkard takes tot
Junkie takes a jot
If you steal something you go to court
Young girl has worn short dress
Yo yo doesn't like socks
You've gone to school to do a course to turn the boss of a foolish person
Mad man dey touch
Lights out wants torch
Fanta and malt, which one costs
you don't know because you are the boss of palm wine
It is his taste of course
Talkative is waiting for pause
If a child cries we give him breasts to play
But if a man holds it it removes
I'll talk in parables
Every white man's teeth is decayed
I take it back, if I don't say it well I'll get a slap
Rap is my sibling so he calls me big bro
If you talk a lot then it means you don't have money
If you brush your teeth, it can spoil your teeth
I'm using a tooth, I'm using a chewing stick, that's my new taste
I believe in instincts more than in reason

Listen, for if you don't listen you'll listen
Don't fear, do as you wish for only you receive your salary

You have your feelings I have mine
Leave me to my doings

Whether you do it or not we'll talk focus and do what you want

Listen, for if you don't listen you'll listen

I want the difference between Zoomlion and Town Council
Who has gone to school and know Mathematics of trash
Just say one's scent is like tear gas
Sandals are very expensive so I'm using slippers
The pastor's church doesn't pay taxes
If the driver's mate doesn't understand English then not Away bus
When it comes to football I swear I dey play pass
Didn't Micheal Essien leave Chealsea for Ajax
It's his taste, run and be late
If you know that you hate
Make you no underrate, that me the ish
Force and get a wish
Fisherman catches fish to prepare his dish
Common tilapia is very expesive, if you use a car to pay then you start to think
If your food burns then it's not cooked
You use Nokia, I use Chinese
If the naked says he'll give you clothes listen to his name
Listen, which lizard grows hair
If someone wakes up, his mouth smell is like
What someone usually does is his lie
Remember if you do one he'll do five
The mouth of gossips are sharper than knife
Fresh boys in the building TM for life
If someone drinks his juice and blows fuse and you smell it I swear you'll be confused
Ebenezer Tettey Huse, we say he is cute
He makes everyone pay dues in parliament
But for me I refuse to be acute to give children drug abuse
Just to mention few for my crew and I
Fresh boys in the building be what we go choose
Happiness for the spot
A drunkard takes tot
Junkie takes a jot
If you steal something you go to court
Young girl has worn short dress
Yo yo doesn't like socks
You've gone to school to do a course to turn the boss of a foolish person
Mad man dey touch
Lights out wants torch
Fanta and malt, which one costs
you don't know because you are the boss of palm wine
It is his taste of course
Talkative is waiting for pause
If a child cries we give him breasts to play
But if a man holds it it removes
I'll talk in parables

Who has gone to school and know Mathematics of trash
Just say one's scent is like tear gas
Sandals are very expensive so I'm using slippers
The pastor's church doesn't pay taxes
If the driver's mate doesn't understand English then not Away bus
When it comes to football I swear I dey play pass
Didn't Micheal Essien leave Chealsea for Ajax
It's his taste, run and be late
If you know that you hate
Make you no underrate, that me the ish
Force and get a wish
Fisherman catches fish to prepare his dish
Common tilapia is very expesive, if you use a car to pay then you start to think
If your food burns then it's not cooked
You use Nokia, I use Chinese
If the naked says he'll give you clothes listen to his name
Listen, which lizard grows hair
If someone wakes up, his mouth smell is like
What someone usually does is his lie
Remember if you do one he'll do five
The mouth of gossips are sharper than knife
Fresh boys in the building TM for life
If someone drinks his juice and blows fuse and you smell it I swear you'll be confused
Ebenezer Tettey Huse, we say he is cute
He makes everyone pay dues in parliament
But for me I refuse to be acute to give children drug abuse
Just to mention few for my crew and I
Fresh boys in the building be what we go choose
Happiness for the spot
A drunkard takes tot
Junkie takes a jot
If you steal something you go to court
Young girl has worn short dress
Yo yo doesn't like socks
You've gone to school to do a course to turn the boss of a foolish person
Mad man dey touch
Lights out wants torch
Fanta and malt, which one costs
you don't know because you are the boss of palm wine
It is his taste of course
Talkative is waiting for pause
If a child cries we give him breasts to play
But if a man holds it it removes
I'll talk in parables
Every white man's teeth is decayed
I take it back, if I don't say it well I'll get a slap
Rap is my sibling so he calls me big bro
If you talk a lot then it means you don't have money
If you brush your teeth, it can spoil your teeth
I'm using a tooth, I'm using a chewing stick, that's my new taste
I believe in instincts more than in reason
So do what pleases you

So take my heart (that's right)
You're my number one buge
I ask of wine from you
Kiss me with your lips (mwah)
For me to get new lyrics to write my remaining songs
Tell me a proverb with your eyes for I'll understand
Start and sing me a sweet song for me to back
If not that I met you, I'll still be gnashing
So baby I thank you
When you're bored call, re le le ooo (the girl)
Any time anywhere re le le ooo
For she is worthy
My love, turn 
For you're the only one I'll praise

But when I went to climb some a climbed a Kokoram D)t)
I've slipped and my hands have saved me, Onyina has let me down
For the land to teach me to walk, the child of a bird I'm in the woods
Like a worm in the midst of Nkrane oo wind eh
Seeker of good I'm filled with tears, it's grit
The plight of the visitor (x2) is sad
I've travelled and travelled
The exhausted I've made a bad visit, the problems of travelling are very sad
The story of my travels are filled with tears, they're like the mighty waters
The plight of the traveller (x2) is sad
The plight of the traveller (x2) 
The plight of the traveller Oh mother
The plight of the traveller (x2) is sad
We're all traveling
Some with charriots, some with planes but we are trekking
But by all means we'll all get there
The children of the tired who are left behind will get there
We'll get to wherever we're going
He told the house that he'll spend three days
Agyekum bye bye oo
He's overstayed till he's tired
Kwame Agyekum and the world, accidents are slippery
A mighty tree is before him
How can he climb it, the story of the poor is sad
He's in rugs so he doesn't usually play
The little we shall eat, that's why I'm in so much sweat
He's sweeping and been sent, if it was a test he'll have a C
Since Agyekum came to the world
Singing has been has been on his heart
But when Hammer offered to help him
We say he is arrogant
He's living his life in sorrow
One day his star will shine
Family, as Agyekum is not dead and you're mourning him
But if he was wealthy you would have crowned him king
Because his life is not going on well
When he passes then you hold your noses
As for me I'm touched
Whatever he says I've accepted
He hasn't given me anything but when he brought me a platter
I didn't cast it away
Now to my niggas on the block, you know what time it is
I've waken up at dawn with tiring menial work
Still and stagnat water, and it's struggles
Poverty has made me travell badly, when they meet in the forest they speak of me
You would have seen that we the travellers, are really suffering
When my mother birthed me on the mat, I couldn't cry
It was later when I cried, because this world is filled with sorrow
But whether we like it or not we're already in this world
If we didn't come to this world we wouldn't have known it's problems
As we've come too we'll leave",Rap,This song tells of the plight of the traveller and the issues they face in their journeys.

Use some to buy a car
To fix wufa

Katiboom
We them boys juice paper chases
Get in the ride we keeping a hundred, we keeping a hundred
You're not a hustler Baba so shut your mouth
Who is talking to me about hand to mouth
I've kept a wake over night, for more than a month
A month a client has sent a little I'll pop ruff
If you wake up in the morning 
Then chant prayers
If you take off your clothes then you turn up your speakers 
Katiboom
Go and sip they owe you and wear your shorts
Open your speakers and play my style 
Katiboom
If you succeed in Ghana then everyone will talk
The pot concerns you the Kutu is pot
I'm like Papa Nii my case is in court
Let me happy myself Oga life is short
If he has gotten hate for me then he has lost
I'm hit in Amakom for them to shock
If you spoil my money and have not Jesus you have lost
Kwaw Kese dey rule even in your court

Boys who always want, single
If you get Becca take
We're coming to rub you like an Owl
Go and ask of me from Racecourse

Look Dadie Opanka
Killer Boobo
Open open for if you won't listen you'll listen
If you look and it hits aa for the poppin (x3)
For the for the poppin (x3)
If the thing hits you aa for the bouncing (x3)
For the for the bouncing (x3)
This year they say I'm in Bankok
This year they say I'm long talk
This year if you miss me aaa I'm in Hong Kong
This year if you see me aa I'm James Bond
My son he says Daddy, I want puff puff
He says if Daddy I hit you, give me a response
If I'm like that I go for long talk
If I go and come back I take K)nsh)n
My God who gives me response when he picks me
He says if I worhip him he'll make me strong
Sometimes if you pick me I'll play Rick Ross
When we wear and it's dirty, it goes to dispose
This year we're in Haiti
So they are haiting
Whatever they say for debating
My great covenant fornication
I'm as small as a pin 
So if you sit on me you'll shout
Look and you don't go and roam that you want my prescription
You'll go to jail
Your mustache like sponge
You need Apo
I'm slim but in rap I'm built
Try me and buy
You didn't look sharp for I've surpassed you
I rep the streets ghetto youth
I don't like champagne 
I'll buy juice
You don't know anything Lacto Juice
We draw for you like
Kwaw and I we've dropped a lot so we don't have a problem
We will murder you
I'm not like that but I'll butcher you
This year aftewards then I'll walk in town
Kro kyia, I don't fear the day
If you want lucky look at Drogba
My folder
Oh naa, my rap shows my profile
Brokedown, my knockdown
My mind is more than memory lowdown
To down
I won't be afraid, so so so always
I dey feel your teeth, cos my favorite colour is yellow
You dey talk this for my back but if you see me hello
When we start for talk all the other boys the mellow
So if you see and it hits then come follow
They say I'm a hawk, I'm a hawk hawk
They say I'm tough I'm a Bonton
They say I dey cause, I'm Kwaw long
Kwaw is on 
If it hits, Kwaw song
They say this year I'm at Jupiter
I'm Lucifer
Kwaw the top ranger
They say today I'm a pharmaceutical
I'll give you a bad medicine and that one is critical
They say this year I celebrate Homowo, I celebrate Akwamu and Hogbetsotso
They say this year I'm promising
Everything I do, I'll do it Alo

We've broken up longtime ago
Still canât believe why I let you go!

I've let my love go already
I've acted foolishly and regret it oo
Now I know your love was so divine
Wish I go fit reverse the hand of time
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still got love for you thatâs the fact
And your memories will always be cherished
Your love keep hunting me (Hunting me)
I will forever remember the good time
The way you handle me (handle me)

But my eyes are still after you

Then my eyes tear

So my love eey
Ask my love to forgive me
I've regretted what I did so he should look at me
My lust has served me right
None of my other lovers loved me
I said myself that I've broken up with you
But due to what I've seen with my eyes I've changed my mind
In the night when I remember
The sweet talks I had with you your heart is mine
If not for you I've not worked before
The girl has the heart to wait
I had nothing but you didn't judge me
I miss waking up to find you lying by my side

If you still have my love in your heart

My love Moesha I miss you a lot
God help me let the new day meet me
If I hear your name then I'm shaking
We've broken up longtime ago
Still canât believe why I let you go!
It was a mistake but now I know
I've let my love go already
I've acted foolishly and regret it oo
Now I know your love was so divine
Wish I go fit reverse the hand of time
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still got love for you thatâs the fact
And your memories will always be cherished
Your love keep hunting me (Hunting me)
I will forever remember the good time
The way you handle me (handle me)
We've broken up
But my eyes are still after you
When I remember some of your doings
Then my eyes tear
If I come to your mind
Don't hesitate beauty
My old love ooo call me on the mobile phone eer
Let's talk about ourseves (x2)
Let me just hear your voice (x2)
This evening call me on the mobile phone eer (x2)
Moesha Mosesha I've missed your conversations my love
Moesha Moesha I love you bring back the flavour
Tell me what I go do to win you back (x2) oo
And I go do anything it takes to revive your love
I've seen that I didn't act well
So my love eey
Ask my love to forgive me
I've regretted what I did so he should look at me
My lust has served me right
None of my other lovers loved me
I said myself that I've broken up with you
But due to what I've seen with my eyes I've changed my mind
In the night when I remember
The sweet talks I had with you your heart is mine
If not for you I've not worked before
The girl has the heart to wait
I had nothing but you didn't judge me
I miss waking up to find you lying by my side
So Moesha if you hear my voice
And no one's hand is on you
If you still have my love in your heart
Then do well and come and give me a kiss

My love Moesha I miss you a lot
God help me let the new day meet me
If I hear your name then I'm shaking
We've broken up longtime ago
Still canât believe why I let you go!
It was a mistake but now I know
I've let my love go already
I've acted foolishly and regret it oo
Now I know your love was so divine
Wish I go fit reverse the hand of time
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still got love for you thatâs the fact
And your memories will always be cherished
Your love keep hunting me (Hunting me)
I will forever remember the good time
The way you handle me (handle me)
We've broken up
But my eyes are still after you
When I remember some of your doings
Then my eyes tear
If I come to your mind
Don't hesitate beauty
My old love ooo call me on the mobile phone eer
Let's talk about ourseves (x2)
Let me just hear your voice (x2)
This evening call me on the mobile phone eer (x2)
Moesha Mosesha I've missed your conversations my love
Moesha Moesha I love you bring back the flavour
Tell me what I go do to win you back (x2) oo
And I go do anything it takes to revive your love
I've seen that I didn't act well
So my love eey
Ask my love to forgive me
I've regretted what I did so he should look at me
My lust has served me right
None of my other lovers loved me
I said myself that I've broken up with you
But due to what I've seen with my eyes I've changed my mind
In the night when I remember
The sweet talks I had with you your heart is mine
If not for you I've not worked before
The girl has the heart to wait
I had nothing but you didn't judge me
I miss waking up to find you lying by my side
So Moesha if you hear my voice
And no one's hand is on you
If you still have my love in your heart
Then do well and come and give me a kiss

And they call me Eugene
Baby lemme prepare your heart
l beg I dey wan stay in your heart
I've met many women but I prefer your heart
Love doctor I've come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Commot all the advice you get from peers
Many many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make I know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice my love you dey shiver
I go protect your heart make you be my diva
I'll stay single than to take you and leave
Baby girl ah you come first (x2)
Iâll be here to lay your bed (x2)
Try and leave me, I'll cry for my tears to finish (x2)
Forget it's you that I need my love
Be my baby mama
It's in your mind that one day I'll betray you
Queen Afia Kobi's grandchild
If you give me your heart I'll really love you
You've dated Kumasi and Amaransa

So agree for one day I'll marry you
Kina dÉ daadi kina dÉ kew
The girls are plenty but it's you I want
The way I'm happy it's you I see
The numerous men coming to you I'm the one who loves you
Follow your heart make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance later you give me the praise
My love give me the chance to relieve pains
We mourn still you're great
Baby girl ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed
Lemme show you something
Iâm a Rockstar e no be long thing
It's not like I talk but my pocket has nothing

And they call me Eugene
Baby lemme prepare your heart
l beg I dey wan stay in your heart
I've met many women but I prefer your heart
Love doctor I've come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Commot all the advice you get from peers
Many many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make I know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice my love you dey shiver
I go protect your heart make you be my diva
I'll stay single than to take you and leave
Baby girl ah you come first (x2)
Iâll be here to lay your bed (x2)
Try and leave me, I'll cry for my tears to finish (x2)
Forget it's you that I need my love
Be my baby mama
It's in your mind that one day I'll betray you
Queen Afia Kobi's grandchild
If you give me your heart I'll really love you
You've dated Kumasi and Amaransa
You've carried water and wine
Kwadwo and Kofi and not the same wine
So agree for one day I'll marry you
Kina dÉ daadi kina dÉ kew
The girls are plenty but it's you I want
The way I'm happy it's you I see
The numerous men coming to you I'm the one who loves you
Follow your heart make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance later you give me the praise
My love give me the chance to relieve pains
We mourn still you're great
Baby girl ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed
Lemme show you something
Iâm a Rockstar e no be long thing
It's not like I talk but my pocket has nothing
I mean I know the reason why Iâm confronting
All my love wants is my sweet talk
When Iâm with you I see it all hoilday
You are my love so I dey call you bae oh",Rap,This song tells of the love the singer has for her lover. He tells of the adoration and care he has for him.

And they call me Eugene
Baby lemme prepare your heart
l beg I dey wan stay in your heart
I've met many women but I prefer your heart
Love doctor I've come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Commot all the advice you get from peers
Many many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make I know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice my love you dey shiver
I go protect your heart make you be my diva
I'll stay single than to take you and leave
Baby girl ah you come first (x2)
Iâll be here to lay your bed (x2)
Try and leave me, I'll cry for my tears to finish (x2)
Forget it's you that I need my love
Be my baby mama
It's in your mind that one day I'll betray you
Queen Afia Kobi's grandchild
If you give me your heart I'll really love you
You've dated Kumasi and Amaransa
You've carried water and wine
Kwadwo and Kofi and not the same wine
So agree for one day I'll marry you
Kina dÉ daadi kina dÉ kew
The girls are plenty but it's you I want
The way I'm happy it's you I see
The numerous men coming to you I'm the one who loves you
Follow your heart make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance later you give me the praise
My love give me the chance to relieve pains
We mourn still you're great
Baby girl ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed
Lemme show you something
Iâm a Rockstar e no be long thing
It's not like I talk but my pocket has nothing
I mean I know the reason why Iâm confronting
All my love wants is my sweet talk
When Iâm with you I see it all hoilday
You are my love so I dey call you bae oh",Rap,This song tells of the love the singer has for her lover. He tells of the adoration and care he has for him.

233,Segment_1_Strongman - Last Verse.mp3,Strongman - Last Verse,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odaIrIHkFlU,Twi," Yeah, You say!
Uh, have you head
Hey! Yeah (Tubhani Muzik)
Morning star I'm getting famous
Shine like a star, I was weaned with rap
I'm outspoken, Chairman flow breaks heart
I've put the rap on fire I've roasting it like an eagle
A letter to the whack rappers up for debate
I'm lifting the brand, so the bars elevate
It's not my match anyday day, I have what it takes
One day we'll celebrate my public holiday
Flow, but rap is under my belt
My mouth is sharp so think before you touch me
Chaley, I'm grown with rap enemies flow and blowing their nose
So many lines with so many rhymes
So many tried, and so many died
I've heard this rap, so many times
These set of rappers, I'm so undefined
Always in the T-Shirt, but flow is in my jeans
I've moved forward, paddy, I can see your pains
Started rapping when the Denmarks were the Danes
I don't brag, but my flow is more than your kings
I've gathered rap, the flow, it's not easy
I'm murdering bars, go oo for I have come
The timing is great so the my song has touched your heart
Kwaku, the rap is hotter than summer-summer
Your goats can't make me run, I'm your herdsman
Forget the 'wording', I'm the best man in rap
I keep appearing in your dreams, I'm your nightmare
I stopped crying when I realised awards don't pay rent
No matter how the Tico speeds the Benz sees it as timid
If you try me, like someone from Finland, you are 'finished'
Denswag, drop every beat for we go kill it
I'm afraid of my destroyers, Kwaku Sei I don't play
All of us will pass away but my words are like music
If you had eyes you'll see that curses are different
Regardless, I still made it with the crazy way
Party time every day, so I don't see holidays
Me? To fear Ghanaian rappers 
It's funny like fish a looking for an umbrella on a rainy day
Due to the weight of the puch, me, I don't take body guards
VIP owner, I don't have anything, I have bars
Papa Rasta, I have dough you say I have pass
If man created the world then some will pee gas
If it was left to my enemies I'll always be a sad man
Me, I don't smoke or drink but I'm a bad man
Uh! If you'll brink beef I don't want a soft one
When I buy beef I want a hard one
I stopped crying when I found out that awards don't pay rent",Rap,"In this song, the rapper tells of how great his rap is. And how good he is compared to other rappers.",Positive,0.7961788,0.40734565,-7.121839e-06,0.030333887654752395,"[-3.1646320e+02  1.7407666e+02  3.0468901e+01  3.9953390e-01

Uh, have you head
Hey! Yeah (Tubhani Muzik)
Morning star I'm getting famous
Shine like a star, I was weaned with rap
I'm outspoken, Chairman flow breaks heart
I've put the rap on fire I've roasting it like an eagle
A letter to the whack rappers up for debate
I'm lifting the brand, so the bars elevate
It's not my match anyday day, I have what it takes
One day we'll celebrate my public holiday
Flow, but rap is under my belt
My mouth is sharp so think before you touch me
Chaley, I'm grown with rap enemies flow and blowing their nose
So many lines with so many rhymes
So many tried, and so many died
I've heard this rap, so many times
These set of rappers, I'm so undefined
Always in the T-Shirt, but flow is in my jeans
I've moved forward, paddy, I can see your pains
Started rapping when the Denmarks were the Danes
I don't brag, but my flow is more than your kings
I've gathered rap, the flow, it's not easy
I'm murdering bars, go oo for I have come
The timing is great so the my song has touched your heart
Kwaku, the rap is hotter than summer-summer
Your goats can't make me run, I'm your herdsman
Forget the 'wording', I'm the best man in rap
I keep appearing in your dreams, I'm your nightmare
I stopped crying when I realised awards don't pay rent
No matter how the Tico speeds the Benz sees it as timid
If you try me, like someone from Finland, you are 'finished'
Denswag, drop every beat for we go kill it
I'm afraid of my destroyers, Kwaku Sei I don't play
All of us will pass away but my words are like music
If you had eyes you'll see that curses are different
Regardless, I still made it with the crazy way
Party time every day, so I don't see holidays
Me? To fear Ghanaian rappers 
It's funny like fish a looking for an umbrella on a rainy day
Due to the weight of the puch, me, I don't take body guards
VIP owner, I don't have anything, I have bars
Papa Rasta, I have dough you say I have pass
If man created the world then some will pee gas
If it was left to my enemies I'll always be a sad man
Me, I don't smoke or drink but I'm a bad man

Uh, have you head
Hey! Yeah (Tubhani Muzik)
Morning star I'm getting famous
Shine like a star, I was weaned with rap
I'm outspoken, Chairman flow breaks heart
I've put the rap on fire I've roasting it like an eagle
A letter to the whack rappers up for debate
I'm lifting the brand, so the bars elevate
It's not my match anyday day, I have what it takes
One day we'll celebrate my public holiday
Flow, but rap is under my belt
My mouth is sharp so think before you touch me
Chaley, I'm grown with rap enemies flow and blowing their nose
So many lines with so many rhymes
So many tried, and so many died
I've heard this rap, so many times
These set of rappers, I'm so undefined
Always in the T-Shirt, but flow is in my jeans
I've moved forward, paddy, I can see your pains
Started rapping when the Denmarks were the Danes
I don't brag, but my flow is more than your kings
I've gathered rap, the flow, it's not easy
I'm murdering bars, go oo for I have come
The timing is great so the my song has touched your heart
Kwaku, the rap is hotter than summer-summer
Your goats can't make me run, I'm your herdsman
Forget the 'wording', I'm the best man in rap
I keep appearing in your dreams, I'm your nightmare
I stopped crying when I realised awards don't pay rent
No matter how the Tico speeds the Benz sees it as timid
If you try me, like someone from Finland, you are 'finished'
Denswag, drop every beat for we go kill it
I'm afraid of my destroyers, Kwaku Sei I don't play
All of us will pass away but my words are like music
If you had eyes you'll see that curses are different
Regardless, I still made it with the crazy way
Party time every day, so I don't see holidays
Me? To fear Ghanaian rappers 
It's funny like fish a looking for an umbrella on a rainy day
Due to the weight of the puch, me, I don't take body guards
VIP owner, I don't have anything, I have bars
Papa Rasta, I have dough you say I have pass
If man created the world then some will pee gas
If it was left to my enemies I'll always be a sad man
Me, I don't smoke or drink but I'm a bad man
Uh! If you'll brink beef I don't want a soft one
When I buy beef I want a hard one
