They say I'm quiet because I don't like people
When I speak, they say I'm noisy
Kwaku Ananse, even when I'm asleep, they're gossiping about me
I'm tired, but I've gained a little; Iâve used some to restart
I'm born into this life, and I've put my hand to the ground
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, Iâll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesnât move me
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, Iâll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesnât move me
What I want is to walk with my feet touching the ground
If I donât go, my family will be hungry
I do this for my family and myself
The dream is to conquer hunger
What I want is to walk with my feet touching the ground
If I donât go, my family will be hungry
I do this for my family and myself
The dream is to conquer hunger

A one-man soldier
Iâm not afraid of water, not afraid of fire (woyoo-ii)

When I speak, they say I'm noisy, ah!
Kwaku Ananse, even when I'm asleep, they're out there tarnishing my name
I'm tired, but Iâve gained a little; Iâve used some to restart

I'm born into this life, and I've put my hand to the ground

Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free

I'm tired, but Iâve gained a little; Iâve used some to restart
I'm born into this life, and Iâve put my hand to the ground

Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free

They say I'm quiet because I don't like people
When I speak, they say I'm noisy
Kwaku Ananse, even when I'm asleep, they're gossiping about me
I'm tired, but I've gained a little; Iâve used some to restart
I'm born into this life, and I've put my hand to the ground
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, Iâll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesnât move me
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, Iâll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesnât move me
What I want is to walk with my feet touching the ground
If I donât go, my family will be hungry
I do this for my family and myself

A black butterfly has landed in my town x1
It's burning me (burning me) x1
Iâve slowed down for days x1
For days, I havenât seen my babe x1
I baked a wedding cake x1
I bought a wedding lace x1
But she doesnât want to see my face x1
Talk about the things I do x1
And flights I book to Europe, Dubai x1
Letâs go on holiday x1
Iâm in love, but sheâs not x1
I have the money, but she doesnât want it x1
What do girls really want? x1

I didnât know that you would treat me this way x2
And you drank me like a âCHOCOLATE DRINKâ x1
Skin tight x1
Diamond ring x1
I did everything you wanted x1
I even braided your hair and bought you a wig x1

Oh no, a fool's heart has been played x1
When Iâm not home, everything goes quiet x1
Your boyfriend is there x1
And heâs hugging you tight x1
My heart has been played, my eyes have been deceived x1
A long journey of marriage, let's go x1
A scorpion has blinded my eyes x1
Sow sow sow sow sow (a call to wake up) x1
One girl deceived me x1
Sheâs made me cry x1
I couldnât attend my grandfatherâs funeral x1
Sheâs made my family hurt x1
Once again, she deceived me x3
Sheâs made me cry x1
I feel shattered x1

Hey...yoo
I rushed to pluck pepper to eat
I succeeded, but it was all in vain x1
Life is tossing me in different ways
I took some pills, now trying to find somewhere to sit
Looking for something to see, to become a believer
You are waiting on someone else's god to come
You've had your own, finished it, and even stole what was next to you
We didn't come this far to stop in the middle
No rushing, there's no rushing in this life x2
I can't sleep, whatever you're seeing now has become a debt x2
Life is whipping me, took me from the edge to a deep end x1
Hustling on foreign land, carrying my hustle on my head
Roaming the world with it x1
I carry struggle x1
Mama is calling, the girls are calling, and my father is calling
We didn't come this far to stop in the middle
I am lost somewhere, and I don't remember where I am from x2
On a long journey, there shouldn't be any envy
If you're in a rush, you can go without me
There are ups and downs, but when we're awake, it's all dreams
Nothing is what it seems x1
We still move when we fall off
On this hill, we will jump up again and grab it
We are not competing with anyone","HipHop,Asakaa","The song reflects the resilience and struggles faced in life, capturing the journey of perseverance and self-discovery. It speaks to the hardships of hustling, especially in foreign lands, dealing with unmet expectations, debts, and family pressures, while emphasizing the importance of patience and not comparing oneself to others. Despite setbacks, the message is about enduring challenges without rushing, staying grounded, and moving forwa

September 4th, 1990, something happened that took the world by surprise
My mother don't have, father don't have, 
We suffer
What the streets teach us is differentâfraud, crime; in this world, no one is going to support you; just watch out and stay calm
Kweku, someone is asleep, but I'm wide awake
Itâs your girl on the phone, and Iâm trying to take her
I told Amina, she should stop wasting my time; if I get some money, weâre going to enjoy
Iâm rising like a plantain leaf
Whatâs before me is laid right out
People say I wonât make it, but I always say no to that
My mom prays for me; she never sleeps; I pray every morning
With her prayers, God will listen
Iâll take control, too
Yes, Iâll take control, too
Iâm at a cafÃ© in Taifa, staying alert like Iâm on a sugar high
How many people you know who get 10k every week just like that?
We can even take the money from the spiritualist, but still, weâre going to sleep and thank God
The poverty in my family, all the needsâthey go unsatisfied as if I donât hear it
Ask Neha and Nasir, Iâll take my first 10k and count how much Iâll make
People go to sleep and dream while we stay awake, still grinding
I donât have time for anyone; if you wonât help me, donât bother; Iâm awake
Iâll work hard with the boys
Weâll dig in and think
When we need it, weâll go and grab some copies
If you stand with me, youâre my backup, youâre my support, youâre my posse
They know weâre on top, and theyâre taking note (they understand)
Yeah, if I have what I need, your head will spin
Every night with the boys, weâre out there, speaking in code
Despite everything people do, weâre still holding on
The dream is big; weâll get the money
One day, itâll all come together
