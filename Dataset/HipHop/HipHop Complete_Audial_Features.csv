They say I'm quiet because I don't like people
When I speak, they say I'm noisy
Kwaku Ananse, even when I'm asleep, they're gossiping about me
I'm tired, but I've gained a little; Iâve used some to restart
I'm born into this life, and I've put my hand to the ground
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, Iâll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesnât move me
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, Iâll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesnât move me
What I want is to walk with my feet touching the ground
If I donât go, my family will be hungry
I do this for my family and myself
The dream is to conquer hunger
What I want is to walk with my feet touching the ground
If I donât go, my family will be hungry
I do this for my family and myself
The dream is to conquer hunger

I'm tired, but I've gained a little; Iâve used some to restart
I'm born into this life, and I've put my hand to the ground

Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free

They say I'm quiet because I don't like people
When I speak, they say I'm noisy
Kwaku Ananse, even when I'm asleep, they're gossiping about me
I'm tired, but I've gained a little; Iâve used some to restart
I'm born into this life, and I've put my hand to the ground
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
If I catch it and you have none, I can still pass it on
I cherish every moment; me, my spirit is free
Life is a wild carnival
Let me enjoy my moment, the box is hot
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, Iâll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesnât move me
Thousands hate me, thousands love me
When I fall to the ground, Iâll rise again
When my family eats, I feel at peace
I look at your shoes, Kay, it doesnât move me

You know how we do
We have blown up with a fuse
Two times a day I tell them
Asakaa, wait
Ok ok o
I don't talk much; I just show action
When we pull up on them, AK47 function (tooo tooo)
Theyâre looking for street boy Jay Bhad, they mention
Iâm not capping; this ain't for niggas who canât show us nothing
Gang Gang Gang
She gives me breast, my mind is blown
Iâm a dragon; I canât walk
My team and I are too ahead
Edinko and pills are so fast
We even smoke weed with a twist
Kumerica, Iâm not crazy
Iâm the best, call me Solo
I called Yaa; weâre going to the room (gang)
On them x6
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
On them x6
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
Condemn them, them, them
When we pull up on them
Don't be silly
The street boys have come; weâre serious
Always look for me so I can shine
My demons meet you when weâre in a rush
Trap house is where my street boys are
Eeeyh, eeeyh
Trap boy, street boy, donât come my way
My demons are not okay
When we pull up, theyâre all day
You come with attitude; we stay cool, irrie
On them x4
When we pull up, we condemn everything
Pull up on the scene, see evidence
Go there and we condemn
On them x4
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
Wow! Iâm with a thousand street boys
When we pull up on them, Iâll take your girl seriously
The girl didn't say much; she and I stood outside calling each other
She knows I carry, carry, Iâm a big deal, me and Harry
I thought it was just a one-night stand, but the girl says ""marry, marry""
Grrrrtt!!!
On them x4
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
You all know we ain't joking, man
Shit just began, wait

Ok ok o
I don't talk much; I just show action
When we pull up on them, AK47 function (tooo tooo)
Theyâre looking for street boy Jay Bhad, they mention
Iâm not capping; this ain't for niggas who canât show us nothing
Gang Gang Gang
She gives me breast, my mind is blown
Iâm a dragon; I canât walk
My team and I are too ahead
Edinko and pills are so fast
We even smoke weed with a twist
Kumerica, Iâm not crazy
Iâm the best, call me Solo
I called Yaa; weâre going to the room (gang)
On them x6
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
On them x6
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
Condemn them, them, them
When we pull up on them
Don't be silly
The street boys have come; weâre serious
Always look for me so I can shine
My demons meet you when weâre in a rush
Trap house is where my street boys are
Eeeyh, eeeyh
Trap boy, street boy, donât come my way
My demons are not okay
When we pull up, theyâre all day
You come with attitude; we stay cool, irrie
On them x4
When we pull up, we condemn everything
Pull up on the scene, see evidence
Go there and we condemn
On them x4
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
Wow! Iâm with a thousand street boys
When we pull up on them, Iâll take your girl seriously
The girl didn't say much; she and I stood outside calling each other
She knows I carry, carry, Iâm a big deal, me and Harry
I thought it was just a one-night stand, but the girl says ""marry, marry""
Grrrrtt!!!
On them x4
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them

You all know we ain't joking, man

Woo woo
You know how we do
We have blown up with a fuse
Two times a day I tell them
Asakaa, wait
Ok ok o
I don't talk much; I just show action
When we pull up on them, AK47 function (tooo tooo)
Theyâre looking for street boy Jay Bhad, they mention
Iâm not capping; this ain't for niggas who canât show us nothing
Gang Gang Gang
She gives me breast, my mind is blown
Iâm a dragon; I canât walk
My team and I are too ahead
Edinko and pills are so fast
We even smoke weed with a twist
Kumerica, Iâm not crazy
Iâm the best, call me Solo
I called Yaa; weâre going to the room (gang)
On them x6
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
On them x6
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
Condemn them, them, them
When we pull up on them
Don't be silly
The street boys have come; weâre serious
Always look for me so I can shine
My demons meet you when weâre in a rush
Trap house is where my street boys are
Eeeyh, eeeyh
Trap boy, street boy, donât come my way
My demons are not okay
When we pull up, theyâre all day
You come with attitude; we stay cool, irrie
On them x4
When we pull up, we condemn everything
Pull up on the scene, see evidence
Go there and we condemn
On them x4
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
Wow! Iâm with a thousand street boys
When we pull up on them, Iâll take your girl seriously
The girl didn't say much; she and I stood outside calling each other
She knows I carry, carry, Iâm a big deal, me and Harry
I thought it was just a one-night stand, but the girl says ""marry, marry""
Grrrrtt!!!
On them x4
When we pull up on them
You hear grrrrr on them
We condemn everything
You all know we ain't joking, man

Keep it gangsta
Come home and Iâll show you my talent
You know what comes with Kawabanga
We enter with full strength
Some brothers are falling
My brothers are calling
If you donât roll with the gang, weâre shunning
Nana, what do you want?
Iâm not going to beg you
Let me not drag this out
From Ghana to Sweden, ah
And I'm okay
What are you going to say?
Running the whole city back in the days
Pulling my lace
Came from the bottom
Damn, and the ladies are crushing on me
Oseikrom gangsta
Big ups to my hommies Reggie, YGA, Thunder
Came from humble beginnings
Now Iâm entering
Been through a lot
So Willy gives me vodka
Kawabanga

Baby girl says Iâm nice

Ahh come on x2
Asakaa...asakaa x2
Hey...yoo
I rushed to pluck pepper to eat
I succeeded, but it was all in vain x1
Life is tossing me in different ways
I took some pills, now trying to find somewhere to sit
Looking for something to see, to become a believer
You are waiting on someone else's god to come
You've had your own, finished it, and even stole what was next to you
We didn't come this far to stop in the middle
No rushing, there's no rushing in this life x2
I can't sleep, whatever you're seeing now has become a debt x2
Life is whipping me, took me from the edge to a deep end x1
Hustling on foreign land, carrying my hustle on my head
Roaming the world with it x1
I carry struggle x1
Mama is calling, the girls are calling, and my father is calling
We didn't come this far to stop in the middle
I am lost somewhere, and I don't remember where I am from x2
On a long journey, there shouldn't be any envy
If you're in a rush, you can go without me
There are ups and downs, but when we're awake, it's all dreams
Nothing is what it seems x1
We still move when we fall off
On this hill, we will jump up again and grab it
We are not competing with anyone","HipHop,Asakaa","The song reflects the resilience and struggles faced in life, capturing the journey of perseverance and self-discovery. It speaks to the hardships of hustling, especially in foreign lands, dealing with unmet expectations, debts, and family pressures, while emphasizing the importance of patience and not comparing oneself to others.

Ahh come on x2
Asakaa...asakaa x2
Hey...yoo
I rushed to pluck pepper to eat
I succeeded, but it was all in vain x1
Life is tossing me in different ways
I took some pills, now trying to find somewhere to sit
Looking for something to see, to become a believer
You are waiting on someone else's god to come
You've had your own, finished it, and even stole what was next to you
We didn't come this far to stop in the middle
No rushing, there's no rushing in this life x2
I can't sleep, whatever you're seeing now has become a debt x2
Life is whipping me, took me from the edge to a deep end x1
Hustling on foreign land, carrying my hustle on my head
Roaming the world with it x1
I carry struggle x1
Mama is calling, the girls are calling, and my father is calling
We didn't come this far to stop in the middle
I am lost somewhere, and I don't remember where I am from x2
On a long journey, there shouldn't be any envy
If you're in a rush, you can go without me
There are ups and downs, but when we're awake, it's all dreams
Nothing is what it seems x1
We still move when we fall off
On this hill, we will jump up again and grab it
We are not competing with anyone","HipHop,Asakaa","The song reflects the resilience and struggles faced in life, capturing the journey of perseverance and self-discovery. It speaks to the hardships of hustling, especially in foreign lands, dealing with unmet expectations, debts, and family pressures, while emphasizing the importance of patience and not comparing oneself to others. Despite setbacks, the message is about enduring challenges without rushing, staying grounded, and moving forwa

September 4th, 1990, something happened that took the world by surprise
My mother don't have, father don't have, 
We suffer
What the streets teach us is differentâfraud, crime; in this world, no one is going to support you; just watch out and stay calm
Kweku, someone is asleep, but I'm wide awake
Itâs your girl on the phone, and Iâm trying to take her
I told Amina, she should stop wasting my time; if I get some money, weâre going to enjoy
Iâm rising like a plantain leaf

Weâll dig in and think

They know weâre on top, and theyâre taking note (they understand)
Yeah, if I have what I need, your head will spin
Every night with the boys, weâre out there, speaking in code
Despite everything people do, weâre still holding on
The dream is big; weâll get the money
One day, itâll all come together

They enjoy the fine things, yet wonât let others even drink a sip from their cup
September 4th, 1990, something happened that took the world by surprise
My mother don't have, father don't have, 
We suffer
What the streets teach us is differentâfraud, crime; in this world, no one is going to support you; just watch out and stay calm
Kweku, someone is asleep, but I'm wide awake
Itâs your girl on the phone, and Iâm trying to take her
I told Amina, she should stop wasting my time; if I get some money, weâre going to enjoy
Iâm rising like a plantain leaf
Whatâs before me is laid right out
People say I wonât make it, but I always say no to that
My mom prays for me; she never sleeps; I pray every morning
With her prayers, God will listen
Iâll take control, too
Yes, Iâll take control, too
Iâm at a cafÃ© in Taifa, staying alert like Iâm on a sugar high
How many people you know who get 10k every week just like that?
We can even take the money from the spiritualist, but still, weâre going to sleep and thank God
The poverty in my family, all the needsâthey go unsatisfied as if I donât hear it
Ask Neha and Nasir, Iâll take my first 10k and count how much Iâll make
People go to sleep and dream while we stay awake, still grinding
I donât have time for anyone; if you wonât help me, donât bother; Iâm awake
Iâll work hard with the boys
Weâll dig in and think
When we need it, weâll go and grab some copies
If you stand with me, youâre my backup, youâre my support, youâre my posse
They know weâre on top, and theyâre taking note (they understand)
Yeah, if I have what I need, your head will spin
Every night with the boys, weâre out there, speaking in code
Despite everything people do, weâre still holding on
The dream is big; weâll get the money
One day, itâll all come together
Iâm rising like a plantain leaf
Whatâs before me is laid right out
They say I wonât make it
I always say no to that
My mom prays for me; she never sleeps; I pray every morning
With her prayers, God will listen
Iâll take control, too
Iâm rising like a plantain leaf
Whatâs before me is laid right out
They say I wonât make it
I always say no to that
My mom prays for me; she never sleeps; I pray every morning
With her prayers, God will listen
Iâll take control, too","HipHop,Asakaa","The song reflects resilience and ambition, depicting the struggle of overcoming poverty and hardships while staying focused on achieving success. It emphasizes faith, perseverance, and loyalty to friends and family, all while pushing through obstacles with determination.

The lazy one only gives his hope to the pastor
Every day weâre stacking money double double
My mindâs on my money, we donât want your trouble
Because when we started rapping back in TMA
The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
Iâm ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, donât care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
Iâm grinding for things Iâve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
Weâre like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses
Survival comes in many ways

Iâve been, Iâve been, Iâve been (Young Arthur preach!)
Iâve been looking for myself
Forget about cash, I want wealth
Don't let them say Iâm weak
God, show me the way to get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, g-get it
I donât have the heart to trust in money rituals
Give me strength because I want to blow up
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Yeah, yeah
Okay, listen!
Every day we hustle hustle
The lazy one only gives his hope to the pastor
Every day weâre stacking money double double
My mindâs on my money, we donât want your trouble
Because when we started rapping back in TMA
The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
Iâm ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, donât care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
Iâm grinding for things Iâve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
Weâre like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses
Survival comes in many ways
Donât waste money in the club if your rent is even paid by your lady
Look at me, I might look grown but money is blood, so I still have a baby face

Swerg! Poof! Damn!
Man, what day is today?
Itâs not yesterday, I couldnât even sleep in my bed
Because music money is only 20%
Iâm a boss in the block, distributing cement
They say I should repent because they want me to descend
Your head looks like âI want changeâ
How will I buy the Benz?
How will I make your girl come around and dance?
I do it for my real hustlers in the pent (say my name)
Shout-out to ShowBoy, the people talk, and it affects him
Youâre lucky you donât have a life or career like I ended it (Damn!)
I still sort things out like plasma, itâs me who mounts it
Counting and telling Waddle to try discounting it
Iâm always after paper
Zoomlion will sign me later (Swerg!)
Iâm like Noreaga
I think Iâm Big Meech, three weeks no sleep, too deep chasing dreams
Free Meek, feed me, bring beef, put this on repeat

Every day we hustle hustle
The lazy one only gives his hope to the pastor
Every day weâre stacking money double double
My mindâs on my money, we donât want your trouble
Because when we started rapping back in TMA
The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
Iâm ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, donât care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
Iâm grinding for things Iâve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
Weâre like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses

My mindâs on my money, we donât want your trouble

The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
Iâm ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, donât care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
Iâm grinding for things Iâve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
Weâre like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses

Arrh!
Iâve been, Iâve been, Iâve been (Young Arthur preach!)
Iâve been looking for myself
Forget about cash, I want wealth
Don't let them say Iâm weak
God, show me the way to get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, g-get it
I donât have the heart to trust in money rituals
Give me strength because I want to blow up
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind

Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Monday we grind, Tuesday we grind until Friday we grind, Sunday we grind
Every day we grind, every day we grind
Grind day we grind, grind day we grind
Yeah, yeah
Okay, listen!
Every day we hustle hustle
The lazy one only gives his hope to the pastor
Every day weâre stacking money double double
My mindâs on my money, we donât want your trouble
Because when we started rapping back in TMA
The cash was already in my DNA
I promised my mom things would be okay
Iâm ready for anything that comes my way
I promised, got a new car from the dealership
And my homie just told me some real advice
He said, focus on making money, donât care about silly things
Show me the duffel bag
Iâm grinding for things Iâve never had
On my hustle, trying to be a better dad
Weâre like football players in the field, seven against a quarterback
No food for a lazy man, you need to hustle for rainy days
Man, go and look for work, enough with the excuses
Survival comes in many ways
Donât waste money in the club if your rent is even paid by your lady
Look at me, I might look grown but money is blood, so I still have a baby face

Iâm a boss in the block, distributing cement
They say I should repent because they want me to descend
Your head looks like âI want changeâ
How will I buy the Benz?
How will I make your girl come around and dance?
I do it for my real hustlers in the pent (say my name)
Shout-out to ShowBoy, the people talk, and it affects him
Youâre lucky you donât have a life or career like I ended it (Damn!)
I still sort things out like plasma, itâs me who mounts it
Counting and telling Waddle to try discounting it

But the little money that reaches my hands, I have to give it to Pastor Dadzie

If itâs not A-town, I donât like this beat
Iâm dressing up with swag
Youâre sleeping on me, as if you donât care
They tried to shoot me, but I dodged it
Who is that? (Who?)
Press my stomach, press my honor
If someone is a fool, I donât call anyone
Iâll still finish it
Man has been standing for long
Todayâs not the day
Iâm looking for money like itâs hide and seek weâre playing
Sweet like chicken fillet
The promoter didnât pay him; he should go and pay (yah)
Confirmed, Iâll accept it
We dodge traffic; we donât delay
We donât finish last (not at all)
Weâll win, donât underestimate me (donât underestimate me)
Nowadays itâs all emojis
I donât talk much
If you hear that my guys and I are fighting
Maybe weâre playing Mortal Kombat
Weâre alert, like itâs winter
A hustler has to eat kenkey
Mention my name

Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Theyâre weak, like seven days
Forget it; everyone wants to act two-faced
Buy petrol, you canât be faster than a car
You have no swag; you canât afford it
The last guy who spoke badly about me
I tried calling him, they said,
The number you dialed is unreachable
Medikalâs around, but Iâm still sick sick sick
Youâre watching time, boy, tick tick tick
If I take your girl, Iâve taken her thick body
Poverty shouldnât take your life away
If you donât hustle, youâll sleep hungry
They promised you, but your boss is struggling too
You have a boss who owns a dog
If he blocks you, youâll ghost him
Youâre posing with fake Gucci
Boss is upset, heâs paying and the boys are struggling
This is the time; go look for money
While youâre talking, my Benz horn is blasting
I donât like (mmh)
Bad energy, I donât like it (mmh)
If itâs going wrong, I donât like it (mmh)
Ask OG or Krept (mmh)
About a hundred Gs for a concert (mmh)
So many people at the concert (mmh)
Your girlâs chest is pushing out of her corset (mmh)
She wants Cardi B; sheâs got her Offset (mmmh)
Hustling is not for me
My uncle and I are working hard
This world is like darkness
I say my piece, I get kicked out
Azigiza is dancing in bloom
I greet them as I walk by
La hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings

Your foolishness (your foolishness)
Mmh mmh mmh",HipHop,"The song La Hustle emphasizes the importance of working hard to survive and succeed in a challenging environment. The artists talk about the struggles and competition in life, especially the need to hustle and earn money to avoid poverty.

If itâs not A-town, I donât like this beat
Iâm dressing up with swag
Youâre sleeping on me, as if you donât care
They tried to shoot me, but I dodged it
Who is that? (Who?)
Press my stomach, press my honor
If someone is a fool, I donât call anyone
Iâll still finish it
Man has been standing for long
Todayâs not the day
Iâm looking for money like itâs hide and seek weâre playing
Sweet like chicken fillet
The promoter didnât pay him; he should go and pay (yah)
Confirmed, Iâll accept it
We dodge traffic; we donât delay
We donât finish last (not at all)
Weâll win, donât underestimate me (donât underestimate me)
Nowadays itâs all emojis
I donât talk much
If you hear that my guys and I are fighting
Maybe weâre playing Mortal Kombat
Weâre alert, like itâs winter
A hustler has to eat kenkey
Mention my name
La hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die (If you donât hustle, youâll die)
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Mmh mmh mmh
Mmh mmh mmh
Your foolishness (your foolishness)
Mmh mmh mmh (pow)
The hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die (If you donât hustle, youâll die)
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Theyâre weak, like seven days
Forget it; everyone wants to act two-faced
Buy petrol, you canât be faster than a car
You have no swag; you canât afford it
The last guy who spoke badly about me
I tried calling him, they said,
The number you dialed is unreachable
Medikalâs around, but Iâm still sick sick sick
Youâre watching time, boy, tick tick tick
If I take your girl, Iâve taken her thick body
Poverty shouldnât take your life away
If you donât hustle, youâll sleep hungry
They promised you, but your boss is struggling too
You have a boss who owns a dog
If he blocks you, youâll ghost him
Youâre posing with fake Gucci
Boss is upset, heâs paying and the boys are struggling
This is the time; go look for money
While youâre talking, my Benz horn is blasting
I donât like (mmh)
Bad energy, I donât like it (mmh)
If itâs going wrong, I donât like it (mmh)
Ask OG or Krept (mmh)
About a hundred Gs for a concert (mmh)
So many people at the concert (mmh)
Your girlâs chest is pushing out of her corset (mmh)
She wants Cardi B; sheâs got her Offset (mmmh)
Hustling is not for me
My uncle and I are working hard
This world is like darkness
I say my piece, I get kicked out
Azigiza is dancing in bloom
I greet them as I walk by
La hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings

You have a boss who owns a dog
If he blocks you, youâll ghost him
Youâre posing with fake Gucci
Boss is upset, heâs paying and the boys are struggling
This is the time; go look for money
While youâre talking, my Benz horn is blasting
I donât like (mmh)
Bad energy, I donât like it (mmh)
If itâs going wrong, I donât like it (mmh)
Ask OG or Krept (mmh)
About a hundred Gs for a concert (mmh)
So many people at the concert (mmh)
Your girlâs chest is pushing out of her corset (mmh)
She wants Cardi B; sheâs got her Offset (mmmh)
Hustling is not for me
My uncle and I are working hard
This world is like darkness
I say my piece, I get kicked out
Azigiza is dancing in bloom
I greet them as I walk by
La hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings

If itâs not A-town, I donât like this beat
Iâm dressing up with swag
Youâre sleeping on me, as if you donât care
They tried to shoot me, but I dodged it
Who is that? (Who?)
Press my stomach, press my honor
If someone is a fool, I donât call anyone
Iâll still finish it
Man has been standing for long
Todayâs not the day
Iâm looking for money like itâs hide and seek weâre playing
Sweet like chicken fillet
The promoter didnât pay him; he should go and pay (yah)
Confirmed, Iâll accept it
We dodge traffic; we donât delay
We donât finish last (not at all)
Weâll win, donât underestimate me (donât underestimate me)
Nowadays itâs all emojis
I donât talk much
If you hear that my guys and I are fighting
Maybe weâre playing Mortal Kombat
Weâre alert, like itâs winter
A hustler has to eat kenkey
Mention my name

If you donât hustle, youâll die (If you donât hustle, youâll die)
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Theyâre weak, like seven days
Forget it; everyone wants to act two-faced
Buy petrol, you canât be faster than a car
You have no swag; you canât afford it
The last guy who spoke badly about me
I tried calling him, they said,
The number you dialed is unreachable
Medikalâs around, but Iâm still sick sick sick
Youâre watching time, boy, tick tick tick
If I take your girl, Iâve taken her thick body
Poverty shouldnât take your life away
If you donât hustle, youâll sleep hungry

Iâm looking for money like itâs hide and seek weâre playing
Sweet like chicken fillet
The promoter didnât pay him; he should go and pay (yah)
Confirmed, Iâll accept it
We dodge traffic; we donât delay
We donât finish last (not at all)
Weâll win, donât underestimate me (donât underestimate me)
Nowadays itâs all emojis
I donât talk much
If you hear that my guys and I are fighting
Maybe weâre playing Mortal Kombat
Weâre alert, like itâs winter
A hustler has to eat kenkey
Mention my name
La hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die (If you donât hustle, youâll die)
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Mmh mmh mmh
Mmh mmh mmh
Your foolishness (your foolishness)
Mmh mmh mmh (pow)
The hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die (If you donât hustle, youâll die)
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Theyâre weak, like seven days
Forget it; everyone wants to act two-faced
Buy petrol, you canât be faster than a car
You have no swag; you canât afford it
The last guy who spoke badly about me
I tried calling him, they said,
The number you dialed is unreachable
Medikalâs around, but Iâm still sick sick sick
Youâre watching time, boy, tick tick tick
If I take your girl, Iâve taken her thick body
Poverty shouldnât take your life away
If you donât hustle, youâll sleep hungry
They promised you, but your boss is struggling too
You have a boss who owns a dog
If he blocks you, youâll ghost him
Youâre posing with fake Gucci
Boss is upset, heâs paying and the boys are struggling
This is the time; go look for money
While youâre talking, my Benz horn is blasting
I donât like (mmh)
Bad energy, I donât like it (mmh)
If itâs going wrong, I donât like it (mmh)
Ask OG or Krept (mmh)
About a hundred Gs for a concert (mmh)
So many people at the concert (mmh)
Your girlâs chest is pushing out of her corset (mmh)
She wants Cardi B; sheâs got her Offset (mmmh)
Hustling is not for me
My uncle and I are working hard
This world is like darkness
I say my piece, I get kicked out
Azigiza is dancing in bloom
I greet them as I walk by
La hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die

Mad oh (same question)
DJ Krept

If itâs not A-town, I donât like this beat
Iâm dressing up with swag
Youâre sleeping on me, as if you donât care
They tried to shoot me, but I dodged it
Who is that? (Who?)
Press my stomach, press my honor
If someone is a fool, I donât call anyone
Iâll still finish it
Man has been standing for long
Todayâs not the day
Iâm looking for money like itâs hide and seek weâre playing
Sweet like chicken fillet
The promoter didnât pay him; he should go and pay (yah)
Confirmed, Iâll accept it
We dodge traffic; we donât delay
We donât finish last (not at all)
Weâll win, donât underestimate me (donât underestimate me)
Nowadays itâs all emojis
I donât talk much
If you hear that my guys and I are fighting
Maybe weâre playing Mortal Kombat
Weâre alert, like itâs winter
A hustler has to eat kenkey
Mention my name
La hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die (If you donât hustle, youâll die)
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Mmh mmh mmh
Mmh mmh mmh
Your foolishness (your foolishness)
Mmh mmh mmh (pow)
The hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die (If you donât hustle, youâll die)
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings
Theyâre weak, like seven days
Forget it; everyone wants to act two-faced
Buy petrol, you canât be faster than a car
You have no swag; you canât afford it
The last guy who spoke badly about me
I tried calling him, they said,
The number you dialed is unreachable
Medikalâs around, but Iâm still sick sick sick
Youâre watching time, boy, tick tick tick
If I take your girl, Iâve taken her thick body
Poverty shouldnât take your life away
If you donât hustle, youâll sleep hungry
They promised you, but your boss is struggling too
You have a boss who owns a dog
If he blocks you, youâll ghost him
Youâre posing with fake Gucci
Boss is upset, heâs paying and the boys are struggling
This is the time; go look for money
While youâre talking, my Benz horn is blasting
I donât like (mmh)
Bad energy, I donât like it (mmh)
If itâs going wrong, I donât like it (mmh)
Ask OG or Krept (mmh)
About a hundred Gs for a concert (mmh)
So many people at the concert (mmh)
Your girlâs chest is pushing out of her corset (mmh)
She wants Cardi B; sheâs got her Offset (mmmh)
Hustling is not for me
My uncle and I are working hard
This world is like darkness
I say my piece, I get kicked out
Azigiza is dancing in bloom
I greet them as I walk by
La hustle ooh
If you donât hustle, youâll die
Theyâre waiting for money
Pray for your blessings

A beautiful girl who said her name is Agyeiwaa
Sheâs always at home and doesnât go out
Her father is wealthy and has money at home
Thereâs wealth at home, and when she eats pizza, she says itâs like konkonte (a local dish)
I told my friend about her, and he went to her house one day
When her dad is home, she doesnât step outside
The boys want her, theyâre all yearning for her
Agyeiwaa also makes me feel special
Sheâs not into the outside life; she says, âIf you want to see me, come homeâ
The first time I saw Agyeiwaa, she blew my mind like Kyeiwaa (a popular actress)
I didnât know she was a homebody but also wants to work
When you see her, her curves amaze you
Her body drives you crazy
I told her, âIf you donât like me, please donât waste my timeâ
Iâm troubled, and I canât even sleep
Letâs go home and meet the family
The boys gossip, but I donât mind
Agyeiwaa says she just wants to hold my hand
The things we do for love, itâs amazing what sheâs willing to do
If I wrong her, she wonât say a word
You wonât believe what I saw on my way
A beautiful girl who said her name is Agyeiwaa
Sheâs always at home and doesnât go out
Her father is wealthy and has money at home
I call, but she doesnât pick up
Her friends tease her when they see us together
Iâm a gangster in love, not a soft guy, but when I go to her house, I treat her right
I trust her because sheâs classy
Her scent lingers, even if itâs not a luxury perfume, it smells nice
Agyeiwaa is unique
Her mom wants her to marry a doctor, but I have more style than a rich manâs son
She finished senior high and is now in college
Her ex-boyfriend is an administrator at Legon
Iâm a bad boy and sheâs into me, not her ex from Ofori Krom
She says she wants only me
She likes my dreadlocks
She makes me feel special, and I also feel the same about her
Every morning, sheâs on my mind
She says Gucci doesnât excite her as much as my love does
Iâm from DC, not Dansoman
She calls me, and I hold her close
Last time we met, the whole YGA squad knew about it
You wonât believe what I saw on my way

A beautiful girl who said her name is Agyeiwaa
Sheâs always at home and doesnât go out
Her father is wealthy and has money at home
Thereâs wealth at home, and when she eats pizza, she says itâs like konkonte (a local dish)
I told my friend about her, and he went to her house one day
When her dad is home, she doesnât step outside
The boys want her, theyâre all yearning for her
Agyeiwaa also makes me feel special
Sheâs not into the outside life; she says, âIf you want to see me, come homeâ
The first time I saw Agyeiwaa, she blew my mind like Kyeiwaa (a popular actress)
I didnât know she was a homebody but also wants to work
When you see her, her curves amaze you

I told her, âIf you donât like me, please donât waste my timeâ
Iâm troubled, and I canât even sleep
Letâs go home and meet the family
The boys gossip, but I donât mind
Agyeiwaa says she just wants to hold my hand
The things we do for love, itâs amazing what sheâs willing to do

Iâm a gangster in love, not a soft guy, but when I go to her house, I treat her right
I trust her because sheâs classy
Her scent lingers, even if itâs not a luxury perfume, it smells nice
Agyeiwaa is unique
Her mom wants her to marry a doctor, but I have more style than a rich manâs son
She finished senior high and is now in college
Her ex-boyfriend is an administrator at Legon
Iâm a bad boy and sheâs into me, not her ex from Ofori Krom
She says she wants only me
She likes my dreadlocks
She makes me feel special, and I also feel the same about her

A beautiful girl who said her name is Agyeiwaa
Sheâs always at home and doesnât go out
Her father is wealthy and has money at home
Thereâs wealth at home, and when she eats pizza, she says itâs like konkonte (a local dish)
I told my friend about her, and he went to her house one day
When her dad is home, she doesnât step outside
The boys want her, theyâre all yearning for her
Agyeiwaa also makes me feel special
Sheâs not into the outside life; she says, âIf you want to see me, come homeâ
The first time I saw Agyeiwaa, she blew my mind like Kyeiwaa (a popular actress)
I didnât know she was a homebody but also wants to work
When you see her, her curves amaze you
Her body drives you crazy
I told her, âIf you donât like me, please donât waste my timeâ
Iâm troubled, and I canât even sleep
Letâs go home and meet the family
The boys gossip, but I donât mind
Agyeiwaa says she just wants to hold my hand
The things we do for love, itâs amazing what sheâs willing to do
If I wrong her, she wonât say a word

Iâm a gangster in love, not a soft guy, but when I go to her house, I treat her right
I trust her because sheâs classy
Her scent lingers, even if itâs not a luxury perfume, it smells nice
Agyeiwaa is unique
Her mom wants her to marry a doctor, but I have more style than a rich manâs son
She finished senior high and is now in college
Her ex-boyfriend is an administrator at Legon
Iâm a bad boy and sheâs into me, not her ex from Ofori Krom
She says she wants only me
She likes my dreadlocks
She makes me feel special, and I also feel the same about her
Every morning, sheâs on my mind
She says Gucci doesnât excite her as much as my love does
Iâm from DC, not Dansoman
She calls me, and I hold her close

Iâm troubled, and I canât even sleep
Letâs go home and meet the family
The boys gossip, but I donât mind

The things we do for love, itâs amazing what sheâs willing to do
If I wrong her, she wonât say a word
You wonât believe what I saw on my way
A beautiful girl who said her name is Agyeiwaa
Sheâs always at home and doesnât go out
Her father is wealthy and has money at home
I call, but she doesnât pick up
Her friends tease her when they see us together
Iâm a gangster in love, not a soft guy, but when I go to her house, I treat her right
I trust her because sheâs classy
Her scent lingers, even if itâs not a luxury perfume, it smells nice
Agyeiwaa is unique
Her mom wants her to marry a doctor, but I have more style than a rich manâs son
She finished senior high and is now in college
Her ex-boyfriend is an administrator at Legon
Iâm a bad boy and sheâs into me, not her ex from Ofori Krom
She says she wants only me
She likes my dreadlocks
She makes me feel special, and I also feel the same about her
Every morning, sheâs on my mind
She says Gucci doesnât excite her as much as my love does
Iâm from DC, not Dansoman

When you're coming, bring Taabea Bitters
I'm stirring things up for some fun
Iâm not playing; Iâm here to make noise until I'm heard (yeah)
Tonight is your chance
The huge chunk is for you, so come get it (look)
Letâs go to one corner, Patapaa-style
Iâll make things hot in here (one corner)
Didnât you hear the banker calling me? (Ring)
He said itâs 10K, but I wonât take it
Iâm someone driving a Benz, Range Rover, mansion
With all this clean cash, what is that? (Charmer)
Nadia, go shopping (Gucci)
Or if you want, take a trot through town (just kidding)
I'm a big man, rich man, yeah man

Theyâre drinking Viagra, Iâll take a break soon
I wonât go long, queen, Iâll place you on your feet
Iâve cleared my mind
Iâm a king, blessing you, Iâll make noise
Stay here, place your feet down
Hey, baby, how you feeling?
Iâm working hard against enemies
Stacking money until it reaches the ceiling
If you donât understand, Iâm saying Iâm focused
If your money talk is shallow, chief, stay away from me
Is your bank big? You canât reach me

When you're coming, bring Taabea Bitters
I'm stirring things up for some fun
Iâm not playing; Iâm here to make noise until I'm heard (yeah)
Tonight is your chance
The huge chunk is for you, so come get it (look)
Letâs go to one corner, Patapaa-style
Iâll make things hot in here (one corner)
Didnât you hear the banker calling me? (Ring)
He said itâs 10K, but I wonât take it
Iâm someone driving a Benz, Range Rover, mansion
With all this clean cash, what is that? (Charmer)
Nadia, go shopping (Gucci)
Or if you want, take a trot through town (just kidding)
I'm a big man, rich man, yeah man
Those guys canât show me anything (hey)

Let me check it out, the burnt rice
Full bottle, but I wonât break it
Theyâre drinking Viagra, Iâll take a break soon
I wonât go long, queen, Iâll place you on your feet
Iâve cleared my mind
Iâm a king, blessing you, Iâll make noise
Stay here, place your feet down
Hey, baby, how you feeling?
Iâm working hard against enemies
Stacking money until it reaches the ceiling
If you donât understand, Iâm saying Iâm focused
If your money talk is shallow, chief, stay away from me
Is your bank big? You canât reach me
Letâs take it to EL, chief, step back, fool

I wonât go long, queen, Iâll place you on your feet
Iâve cleared my mind
Iâm a king, blessing you, Iâll make noise
Stay here, place your feet down
Hey, baby, how you feeling?
Iâm working hard against enemies
Stacking money until it reaches the ceiling
If you donât understand, Iâm saying Iâm focused
If your money talk is shallow, chief, stay away from me
Is your bank big? You canât reach me

Asakaa, whatâs up?
One, two, three, yo
Letâs go to the red room, thatâs where I like
The girl is too fine, she's the one I want
I sold my TV, but her body is what I want to see
Sheâs a brown-skinned baby girl, and she brings me joy
Tinga-linga-linga, tingalingaling
Weâre mixing codeine with Benylin
Iâve prepared some things, just a little of it and I feel strong
God, forgive my sins, tonight I might do wrong
She brings Rosemary Lagata
I give her some weed, ratata
I mix her lean with Fanta
She doesnât know Iâm just a street boy, and my money is running out
Iâm a street guy who speaks his mind
If you donât act too tough, Iâll lay with you
Iâve prepared things, Iâm excited
Tonight, if I press on you, there will be an issue
Tonight, if I press on you, youâll call out my name, Jay Bahd
Yeah, tonight if I press on you, youâll get tired
Tonight if I press on you, youâll say, 'Oh, Jay Bahd'
Tonight if I press on you, things will happen
Over time, I've moved away
Iâve added a lot to myself, and she still comes back to me
Look, Iâve met a beautiful woman who wants to follow me
But she's a traditional girl, and her parents want her to be modest
Sheâs not too wild, sheâs reserved
Sheâs composed, and when I see her, I get excited
A traditional girl, she respects me, but still teases
She doesnât show off too much
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If the day is open, letâs spend time together'
She says she feels me, so even if I donât sleep, I donât mind
If she entices me, I canât resist
She talks about personal things, sharing hidden stories
The money is there, sheâll handle it well
The money is there, sheâll handle it well
I keep watching her, admiring, and I just reach for a drink
On this side, we are loyal, we respect women
So forget about Ato and Amponsah
Come, come, let me lay you down
I wonât just undress you; Iâll place you carefully
She says Iâm well-mannered
I couldnât give her water or clear the path for her
Linda, youâre in my heart, thatâs why I donât sleep
You blocked my calls, but I texted you on Tinder
Check your time, check your calendar
Iâm at your door, thatâs why I came
Iâm entering your world
Weâre in an estate, 'Buokrom'
Entering her world, spoiling her
Ice Cream man is here, filling her world
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If youâre free, letâs spend time together'
She says she feels me, so I donât mind staying awake
If her charm grabs me, I canât complain
She shares her secrets and hidden stories
The money is there; she'll use it well

Asakaa, whatâs up?
One, two, three, yo
Letâs go to the red room, thatâs where I like
The girl is too fine, she's the one I want
I sold my TV, but her body is what I want to see
Sheâs a brown-skinned baby girl, and she brings me joy
Tinga-linga-linga, tingalingaling
Weâre mixing codeine with Benylin
Iâve prepared some things, just a little of it and I feel strong
God, forgive my sins, tonight I might do wrong
She brings Rosemary Lagata
I give her some weed, ratata
I mix her lean with Fanta
She doesnât know Iâm just a street boy, and my money is running out
Iâm a street guy who speaks his mind
If you donât act too tough, Iâll lay with you
Iâve prepared things, Iâm excited
Tonight, if I press on you, there will be an issue
Tonight, if I press on you, youâll call out my name, Jay Bahd
Yeah, tonight if I press on you, youâll get tired
Tonight if I press on you, youâll say, 'Oh, Jay Bahd'
Tonight if I press on you, things will happen
Over time, I've moved away
Iâve added a lot to myself, and she still comes back to me
Look, Iâve met a beautiful woman who wants to follow me
But she's a traditional girl, and her parents want her to be modest
Sheâs not too wild, sheâs reserved
Sheâs composed, and when I see her, I get excited
A traditional girl, she respects me, but still teases
She doesnât show off too much
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If the day is open, letâs spend time together'
She says she feels me, so even if I donât sleep, I donât mind
If she entices me, I canât resist
She talks about personal things, sharing hidden stories
The money is there, sheâll handle it well
The money is there, sheâll handle it well
I keep watching her, admiring, and I just reach for a drink
On this side, we are loyal, we respect women
So forget about Ato and Amponsah
Come, come, let me lay you down
I wonât just undress you; Iâll place you carefully
She says Iâm well-mannered
I couldnât give her water or clear the path for her
Linda, youâre in my heart, thatâs why I donât sleep
You blocked my calls, but I texted you on Tinder
Check your time, check your calendar
Iâm at your door, thatâs why I came
Iâm entering your world
Weâre in an estate, 'Buokrom'
Entering her world, spoiling her
Ice Cream man is here, filling her world
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If youâre free, letâs spend time together'
She says she feels me, so I donât mind staying awake
If her charm grabs me, I canât complain
She shares her secrets and hidden stories
The money is there; she'll use it well

Yeah, tonight if I press on you, youâll get tired
Tonight if I press on you, youâll say, 'Oh, Jay Bahd'
Tonight if I press on you, things will happen
Over time, I've moved away
Iâve added a lot to myself, and she still comes back to me
Look, Iâve met a beautiful woman who wants to follow me
But she's a traditional girl, and her parents want her to be modest
Sheâs not too wild, sheâs reserved
Sheâs composed, and when I see her, I get excited
A traditional girl, she respects me, but still teases
She doesnât show off too much
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If the day is open, letâs spend time together'
She says she feels me, so even if I donât sleep, I donât mind
If she entices me, I canât resist
She talks about personal things, sharing hidden stories
The money is there, sheâll handle it well
The money is there, sheâll handle it well
I keep watching her, admiring, and I just reach for a drink
On this side, we are loyal, we respect women
So forget about Ato and Amponsah
Come, come, let me lay you down
I wonât just undress you; Iâll place you carefully
She says Iâm well-mannered
I couldnât give her water or clear the path for her
Linda, youâre in my heart, thatâs why I donât sleep
You blocked my calls, but I texted you on Tinder
Check your time, check your calendar
Iâm at your door, thatâs why I came
Iâm entering your world
Weâre in an estate, 'Buokrom'
Entering her world, spoiling her
Ice Cream man is here, filling her world
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If youâre free, letâs spend time together'
She says she feels me, so I donât mind staying awake
If her charm grabs me, I canât complain
She shares her secrets and hidden stories
The money is there; she'll use it well

Asakaa, whatâs up?
One, two, three, yo
Letâs go to the red room, thatâs where I like
The girl is too fine, she's the one I want
I sold my TV, but her body is what I want to see
Sheâs a brown-skinned baby girl, and she brings me joy
Tinga-linga-linga, tingalingaling
Weâre mixing codeine with Benylin
Iâve prepared some things, just a little of it and I feel strong
God, forgive my sins, tonight I might do wrong
She brings Rosemary Lagata
I give her some weed, ratata
I mix her lean with Fanta
She doesnât know Iâm just a street boy, and my money is running out
Iâm a street guy who speaks his mind
If you donât act too tough, Iâll lay with you
Iâve prepared things, Iâm excited

Asakaa, whatâs up?
One, two, three, yo
Letâs go to the red room, thatâs where I like
The girl is too fine, she's the one I want
I sold my TV, but her body is what I want to see
Sheâs a brown-skinned baby girl, and she brings me joy
Tinga-linga-linga, tingalingaling
Weâre mixing codeine with Benylin
Iâve prepared some things, just a little of it and I feel strong
God, forgive my sins, tonight I might do wrong
She brings Rosemary Lagata
I give her some weed, ratata
I mix her lean with Fanta
She doesnât know Iâm just a street boy, and my money is running out
Iâm a street guy who speaks his mind
If you donât act too tough, Iâll lay with you
Iâve prepared things, Iâm excited
Tonight, if I press on you, there will be an issue
Tonight, if I press on you, youâll call out my name, Jay Bahd
Yeah, tonight if I press on you, youâll get tired
Tonight if I press on you, youâll say, 'Oh, Jay Bahd'
Tonight if I press on you, things will happen
Over time, I've moved away
Iâve added a lot to myself, and she still comes back to me
Look, Iâve met a beautiful woman who wants to follow me
But she's a traditional girl, and her parents want her to be modest
Sheâs not too wild, sheâs reserved
Sheâs composed, and when I see her, I get excited
A traditional girl, she respects me, but still teases
She doesnât show off too much
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If the day is open, letâs spend time together'
She says she feels me, so even if I donât sleep, I donât mind
If she entices me, I canât resist
She talks about personal things, sharing hidden stories
The money is there, sheâll handle it well
The money is there, sheâll handle it well
I keep watching her, admiring, and I just reach for a drink
On this side, we are loyal, we respect women
So forget about Ato and Amponsah
Come, come, let me lay you down
I wonât just undress you; Iâll place you carefully
She says Iâm well-mannered
I couldnât give her water or clear the path for her
Linda, youâre in my heart, thatâs why I donât sleep
You blocked my calls, but I texted you on Tinder
Check your time, check your calendar
Iâm at your door, thatâs why I came
Iâm entering your world
Weâre in an estate, 'Buokrom'
Entering her world, spoiling her
Ice Cream man is here, filling her world
I keep calling, 'Oh, my Linda, Linda
Check your calendar
If youâre free, letâs spend time together'
She says she feels me, so I donât mind staying awake
If her charm grabs me, I canât complain
She shares her secrets and hidden stories
The money is there; she'll use it well
Stitches on this one, on the mix

I carry heavy burdens, uncertain of what troubles me the most.
All these struggles are for the hustle.

My heart is metal, my words come from deep within.

Iâm in pain, and I need money to ease it.
The one chasing me in life is the one Iâm running from.
Four times over, I feel this pressure.
Yo, YGA, OâKennethâhear my call.
If youâre hunting me, I curse you, for thatâs how youâve shaped me.
If things had gone well, Iâd be better off.
Who understands me now? Iâm like a headless sheep.
Iâve barely walked, yet they ask me to run.
Moneyâjust thinking about it drives me mad.
Itâs like a wild animal, lurking; if itâs nearby, let it come find me.
Food tastes like medicine, but I eat it anyway.
Even the brightest sun casts shadows.
If you owe, pay upâthese streets donât play.
Iâm struggling, feeling empty, but I still wear my colors inside.
We move together, but traps are everywhere.
Ask me whatâs wrong, and I wouldnât know where to begin.
What I see online? Much of itâs fake.
I carry heavy burdens, uncertain of what troubles me the most.
All these struggles are for the hustle.
Iâve been searching, moving forward, running far from home.
I wonât stop now, not ever, not for anything.
My heart is metal, my words come from deep within.
Yes, Iâm rough around the edges, a sinner, weary from the grind.
I need reliefâgive me something to lift this weight.
How can I live without a penny in my pocket, without a cedi or dollar to my name?
Iâve got to go harder, got to be ready.
Lifeâs beating me down, and Iâm losing weight.
Theyâve let my troubles loose, echoing in my mind, bound and relentless.
Hi, my hand is raised as I step inside.
Lifeâs struggles keep me up at night, the ones holding me back, still running.
My rent is due, and theyâve sent reminders.
But no matter how hard they press, I have no money to pay.
","HipHop,Asakaa","The song expresses a deep struggle with lifeâs hardships, especially the relentless pursuit of money to escape poverty and ease pain. The singer feels trapped, constantly chased by invisible pressures and weighed down by unfulfilled goals. Despite the overwhelming challenges, thereâs a determined resolve to keep pushing forward, even while feeling broken and misunderstood.

Iâm on a path, walking and walking, but I still havenât arrived.
Lifeâs got me thinking too deep, pushing me to smoke.
Money is all I needâif you see it, tell it Iâm waiting.
One head, but my heart feels like thirteen, filled with stories both real and funny.
Iâm in pain, and I need money to ease it.
The one chasing me in life is the one Iâm running from.
Four times over, I feel this pressure.
Yo, YGA, OâKennethâhear my call.
If youâre hunting me, I curse you, for thatâs how youâve shaped me.
If things had gone well, Iâd be better off.
Who understands me now? Iâm like a headless sheep.
Iâve barely walked, yet they ask me to run.
Moneyâjust thinking about it drives me mad.
Itâs like a wild animal, lurking; if itâs nearby, let it come find me.
Food tastes like medicine, but I eat it anyway.
Even the brightest sun casts shadows.
If you owe, pay upâthese streets donât play.
Iâm struggling, feeling empty, but I still wear my colors inside.
We move together, but traps are everywhere.
Ask me whatâs wrong, and I wouldnât know where to begin.
What I see online? Much of itâs fake.
I carry heavy burdens, uncertain of what troubles me the most.
All these struggles are for the hustle.
Iâve been searching, moving forward, running far from home.
I wonât stop now, not ever, not for anything.
My heart is metal, my words come from deep within.
Yes, Iâm rough around the edges, a sinner, weary from the grind.
I need reliefâgive me something to lift this weight.
How can I live without a penny in my pocket, without a cedi or dollar to my name?
Iâve got to go harder, got to be ready.
Lifeâs beating me down, and Iâm losing weight.
Theyâve let my troubles loose, echoing in my mind, bound and relentless.
Hi, my hand is raised as I step inside.
Lifeâs struggles keep me up at night, the ones holding me back, still running.
My rent is due, and theyâve sent reminders.
But no matter how hard they press, I have no money to pay.
","HipHop,Asakaa","The song expresses a deep struggle with lifeâs hardships, especially the relentless pursuit of money to escape poverty and ease pain. The singer feels trapped, constantly chased by invisible pressures and weighed down by unfulfilled goals. Despite the overwhelming challenges, thereâs a determined resolve to keep pushing forward, even while feeling broken and misunderstood.

If I donât hear from you, look, I sleep at dawn (Ah, ah).
The girl I call Benedicta,
Put your name in my mind, so I sleep at dawn.
Your beauty surpasses Rosalinda, ah (Killer).
Ayy, ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy
Sankofa, I said letâs not forget (Woah).
Letâs go to school together.
The Dawgi boys, they are all foolish.
Feel your body as I get closer, Iâll be by you.
Boozing-zing, booziing-zing.
The love I have for you is intoxicating.
Trapper girl, she and I share codeine.
What hurts me is how she calls my name.
He calls me King Kong God.
Kwaku Brobbey.
He says he likes water and sweet drinks.
He is drinking sweet water, let me not go there.
He is drinking sweet water, let me not go there.
I am there blessing him.
We ginger, garlic, ready to go home, bringing wealth so we can be wealthy.
The water is flowing; if you complain, I'll take it.
Loneliness, you are the one, it's burdening me.
He says, ""Kofi, when you wake up, Iâll be here with you.""
He says, ""If I see you, Iâll get something to eat, and where I am, itâs a blessing.
When I sleep, itâs a blessing."" (Yeah, man!)
He is showing himself to me.
Good, good (Ayy)
Does he want timber?
What is he like? Patia?
His long height, he has fine features.
Love, give me your strength, Iâll sweep you off your feet.
If I pass and you want to talk, forget Nketiah, yes.
If someone gives you money so you can eat, donât do it.
Iâm sipping Ballaire, bamboo.
Iâll meet your family because of you.
They say I fell down flat for you (Grr).
Queen, come letâs rest.
Tonight, because of you, Iâm going to bed (Ayy).
Queen Afia, you shine bright, so when I call your phone, donât ignore this (Ayy-ayy).
Eh! Iâve come to meet you.
Tonight, whatever I do for you, Iâll say it.
Ayy-ayy! Good, good, good.

And they call me Eugene
Baby, lemme prepare your heart
I beg I dey wan stay in your heart
I have met many girls but I prefer your heart
Love doctor, I have come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Forget all the advice you get from peers
Many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make me know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice, oh love, you dey shiver
I go protect your heart, make you be my diva
I go spoil you so that you forget your sorrows
Baby girl, ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed
Try na gyae me hÉ kÉ na hwÉ oh nka mÉsu ama me nisuo asa

If it enters your mind, I will give you to me
Queen Afia Kobi Nana
If you give your heart to me, I will love you
You who dated Kumasi, dated Amaransa
You finished carrying water, come and carry my hand
Kwadwo and Kofi, itâs not about drinking alcohol
So come, let me not pour my drink on your head
Kina dÉ daadi, kina dÉ kew
Though there are many girls, I love you, I want you
Like the way I love you, I watch you
Many men who come near you, I want you
Follow your heart, make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance, later you give me the praise
My love, give me a chance so I can relieve pains
We work hard but you are still great

And they call me Eugene
Baby, lemme prepare your heart
I beg I dey wan stay in your heart
I have met many girls but I prefer your heart
Love doctor, I have come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Forget all the advice you get from peers
Many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make me know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice, oh love, you dey shiver
I go protect your heart, make you be my diva
I go spoil you so that you forget your sorrows
Baby girl, ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed
Try na gyae me hÉ kÉ na hwÉ oh nka mÉsu ama me nisuo asa
Baby girl, ah you come first

Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love, oh ah ah
Be my baby mama
If it enters your mind, I will give you to me
Queen Afia Kobi Nana
If you give your heart to me, I will love you
You who dated Kumasi, dated Amaransa
You finished carrying water, come and carry my hand
Kwadwo and Kofi, itâs not about drinking alcohol
So come, let me not pour my drink on your head
Kina dÉ daadi, kina dÉ kew
Though there are many girls, I love you, I want you
Like the way I love you, I watch you
Many men who come near you, I want you
Follow your heart, make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance, later you give me the praise
My love, give me a chance so I can relieve pains
We work hard but you are still great
Baby girl, ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed

Lemme show you something
Iâm a Rockstar, itâs no long thing
Itâs not like Iâm talking nonsense
I mean I know the reason why Iâm confronting
When love is sweet, itâs our conversation
When Iâm with you I see it all holiday
You are my love so I dey call you bae, oh

And they call me Eugene
Baby, lemme prepare your heart

Love doctor, I have come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Forget all the advice you get from peers
Many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make me know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice, oh love, you dey shiver
I go protect your heart, make you be my diva

You finished carrying water, come and carry my hand
Kwadwo and Kofi, itâs not about drinking alcohol
So come, let me not pour my drink on your head
Kina dÉ daadi, kina dÉ kew
Though there are many girls, I love you, I want you
Like the way I love you, I watch you
Many men who come near you, I want you
Follow your heart, make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance, later you give me the praise
My love, give me a chance so I can relieve pains
We work hard but you are still great

And they call me Eugene
Baby, lemme prepare your heart
I beg I dey wan stay in your heart
I have met many girls but I prefer your heart
Love doctor, I have come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Forget all the advice you get from peers
Many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make me know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice, oh love, you dey shiver
I go protect your heart, make you be my diva
I go spoil you so that you forget your sorrows
Baby girl, ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed
Try na gyae me hÉ kÉ na hwÉ oh nka mÉsu ama me nisuo asa
Baby girl, ah you come first

Be my baby mama
If it enters your mind, I will give you to me
Queen Afia Kobi Nana
If you give your heart to me, I will love you
You who dated Kumasi, dated Amaransa
You finished carrying water, come and carry my hand
Kwadwo and Kofi, itâs not about drinking alcohol
So come, let me not pour my drink on your head
Kina dÉ daadi, kina dÉ kew
Though there are many girls, I love you, I want you
Like the way I love you, I watch you
Many men who come near you, I want you
Follow your heart, make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance, later you give me the praise
My love, give me a chance so I can relieve pains
We work hard but you are still great
Baby girl, ah you come first

Lemme show you something
Iâm a Rockstar, itâs no long thing
Itâs not like Iâm talking nonsense
I mean I know the reason why Iâm confronting
When love is sweet, itâs our conversation
When Iâm with you I see it all holiday
You are my love so I dey call you bae, oh

And they call me Eugene
Baby, lemme prepare your heart
I beg I dey wan stay in your heart
I have met many girls but I prefer your heart
Love doctor, I have come so let me repair your heart
Give me a chance to wipe your tears
Forget all the advice you get from peers
Many love stories heard in your ears
The tears in your eyes make me know you dey fear
But I promise I go be a better man
I no go tend to be a brotherman
I know say bad guys dey my motherland
I go love you the way you no go need another man
Not all guys are brothers from another mother
I could hear it from your voice, oh love, you dey shiver
I go protect your heart, make you be my diva
I go spoil you so that you forget your sorrows
Baby girl, ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed
Try na gyae me hÉ kÉ na hwÉ oh nka mÉsu ama me nisuo asa
Baby girl, ah you come first

Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love
Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love
Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love, oh ah ah
Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love
Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love
Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love, oh ah ah
Be my baby mama
If it enters your mind, I will give you to me
Queen Afia Kobi Nana
If you give your heart to me, I will love you
You who dated Kumasi, dated Amaransa
You finished carrying water, come and carry my hand
Kwadwo and Kofi, itâs not about drinking alcohol
So come, let me not pour my drink on your head
Kina dÉ daadi, kina dÉ kew
Though there are many girls, I love you, I want you
Like the way I love you, I watch you
Many men who come near you, I want you
Follow your heart, make you no follow your brains
Give me the chance, later you give me the praise
My love, give me a chance so I can relieve pains
We work hard but you are still great
Baby girl, ah you come first
Iâll be here to lay your bed
Try na gyae me hÉ kÉ na hwÉ oh nka mÉsu ama me nisuo asa

Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love
Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love
Forget it, if itâs not you then I need my love, oh ah ah
Lemme show you something
Iâm a Rockstar, itâs no long thing
Itâs not like Iâm talking nonsense
I mean I know the reason why Iâm confronting
When love is sweet, itâs our conversation
When Iâm with you I see it all holiday
You are my love so I dey call you bae, oh
This love is sweet, oh my dear, oh
When love is sweet, itâs our conversation
When Iâm with you I see it all holiday
You are my love so I dey call you bae, oh
This love is sweet, oh my dear, oh

Urgh, I be dema prime target
Everyone is reading a different book to the same subject
I'm not the cause of your problems, I can't withhold progress
You can't blame your mom or blame your dad for your own life's regrets
Real life, I'm a bit calm, but mensuro dirt, Iâm like a pig farm
Big time, youâre a big scam, your favorite rapper is a big fan
Bi mo fame no wÉ lifespan, 'cause to be great, then it takes time
Die-hards wanna die hard, no noise too, required time
If e be money, then I'm all ears
Nansa yi life yÉ so weird, 'cause dream big, dream big
My nigga can't sleep a whole year
Hard core with enough flare, no shades, I dey see clear
Future yÉ so bright, 'cause Naa Sei, I no dey like blur
If doctors were seeds, I swear, their nursing won't be the same (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So many shots, my friend, I'm chasing the game (yeah, yeah)
Let me repeat, ""The king and the chief, them no be the same""
Forget the name, fuck the fame, still, my guy, we no be the same
I'm shaming the critics, flow yÉ so sick, yeah, the flow be poetic
God of rap, you need a verse, then I'll be here to bless it
Sound impressing, so interesting, I need a studio session
You heard the shock, so many naked lines, tell your guy to dress it
Die for the cedi, kill for the cedi, sorry, make head shake like booty
Milk it, flow straight from the titties, oh, gosh, I'm slim like Biggie
One in a milli, songs on the tele, yeah, yeah
Claim rap Ballotelli, Gilmour, I be young, but a Billy
Punches, homie, straight to your belly
Not all the time they need your songs, sometimes they need your sense
Not all the time they need the tongues, at times they need repent
Full force, gravity coming with the full force
When I'm around, nobody fit cough
I meet boys, itâs cool chop, y'all
We told you to mention your top five rappers, not your top five friends
All you could see is the world-wide trappers in the world-wide trends
But still, fuck it, here I am, I'm still a topic
Homie, my bars are just epic
Hate and jealousy, just cut it
In rap, me ne the king of the blacks
Your guys are like Canada blacks
Three years now, you have been the best rapper, itâs good, you're holding my plugs
I dey rhyme right in the lime light
Give us mic, then you see the lame ones
If you don't know what to say, just say my name once
In rap, Iâm the light, Iâm the main line
Continue doubting me, my nigga, even Satan knows the true God
Snooker, black balls are important, so donât give Akosua blue balls
Every day, youâre sleeping, you have become a snail
My flow is tight, Iâm not a waste
Use the fire to cook the good fish
If my verse drops, you will get a hit
They throw shots, but I throw bombs
You stand here, you say far gone
Same book, different authors
Ghana rap, it has nothing to do with stardom
We're pissed already, nobody is pissing us
Usain Bolt, who is chasing us?
My mouth is so precious, so my homie, I can't be kissing ass
Donât come close to me, Zap Mallet height, do you measure Aboagye?
How many teaspoons make one ladle? Rap, if itâs your thing, take it
Naa Sei (hey!)

Homie, my bars are just epic
Hate and jealousy, just cut it
In rap, me ne the king of the blacks
Your guys are like Canada blacks
Three years now, you have been the best rapper, itâs good, you're holding my plugs
I dey rhyme right in the lime light
Give us mic, then you see the lame ones
If you don't know what to say, just say my name once
In rap, Iâm the light, Iâm the main line
Continue doubting me, my nigga, even Satan knows the true God
Snooker, black balls are important, so donât give Akosua blue balls
Every day, youâre sleeping, you have become a snail
My flow is tight, Iâm not a waste
Use the fire to cook the good fish
If my verse drops, you will get a hit
They throw shots, but I throw bombs
You stand here, you say far gone
Same book, different authors
Ghana rap, it has nothing to do with stardom
We're pissed already, nobody is pissing us
Usain Bolt, who is chasing us?
My mouth is so precious, so my homie, I can't be kissing ass
Donât come close to me, Zap Mallet height, do you measure Aboagye?
How many teaspoons make one ladle? Rap, if itâs your thing, take it
Naa Sei (hey!)

Urgh, I be dema prime target
Everyone is reading a different book to the same subject
I'm not the cause of your problems, I can't withhold progress
You can't blame your mom or blame your dad for your own life's regrets
Real life, I'm a bit calm, but mensuro dirt, Iâm like a pig farm
Big time, youâre a big scam, your favorite rapper is a big fan
Bi mo fame no wÉ lifespan, 'cause to be great, then it takes time
Die-hards wanna die hard, no noise too, required time
If e be money, then I'm all ears
Nansa yi life yÉ so weird, 'cause dream big, dream big
My nigga can't sleep a whole year
Hard core with enough flare, no shades, I dey see clear
Future yÉ so bright, 'cause Naa Sei, I no dey like blur
If doctors were seeds, I swear, their nursing won't be the same (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So many shots, my friend, I'm chasing the game (yeah, yeah)
Let me repeat, ""The king and the chief, them no be the same""
Forget the name, fuck the fame, still, my guy, we no be the same
I'm shaming the critics, flow yÉ so sick, yeah, the flow be poetic
God of rap, you need a verse, then I'll be here to bless it
Sound impressing, so interesting, I need a studio session
You heard the shock, so many naked lines, tell your guy to dress it
Die for the cedi, kill for the cedi, sorry, make head shake like booty
Milk it, flow straight from the titties, oh, gosh, I'm slim like Biggie
One in a milli, songs on the tele, yeah, yeah
Claim rap Ballotelli, Gilmour, I be young, but a Billy
Punches, homie, straight to your belly
Not all the time they need your songs, sometimes they need your sense
Not all the time they need the tongues, at times they need repent
Full force, gravity coming with the full force
When I'm around, nobody fit cough
I meet boys, itâs cool chop, y'all
We told you to mention your top five rappers, not your top five friends
All you could see is the world-wide trappers in the world-wide trends

Die-hards wanna die hard, no noise too, required time
If e be money, then I'm all ears
Nansa yi life yÉ so weird, 'cause dream big, dream big
My nigga can't sleep a whole year
Hard core with enough flare, no shades, I dey see clear
Future yÉ so bright, 'cause Naa Sei, I no dey like blur
If doctors were seeds, I swear, their nursing won't be the same (yeah, yeah, yeah)
So many shots, my friend, I'm chasing the game (yeah, yeah)
Let me repeat, ""The king and the chief, them no be the same""
Forget the name, fuck the fame, still, my guy, we no be the same
I'm shaming the critics, flow yÉ so sick, yeah, the flow be poetic
God of rap, you need a verse, then I'll be here to bless it
Sound impressing, so interesting, I need a studio session
You heard the shock, so many naked lines, tell your guy to dress it
Die for the cedi, kill for the cedi, sorry, make head shake like booty
Milk it, flow straight from the titties, oh, gosh, I'm slim like Biggie
One in a milli, songs on the tele, yeah, yeah
Claim rap Ballotelli, Gilmour, I be young, but a Billy
Punches, homie, straight to your belly
Not all the time they need your songs, sometimes they need your sense
Not all the time they need the tongues, at times they need repent
Full force, gravity coming with the full force
When I'm around, nobody fit cough
I meet boys, itâs cool chop, y'all
We told you to mention your top five rappers, not your top five friends
All you could see is the world-wide trappers in the world-wide trends
But still, fuck it, here I am, I'm still a topic
Homie, my bars are just epic
Hate and jealousy, just cut it
In rap, me ne the king of the blacks
Your guys are like Canada blacks
Three years now, you have been the best rapper, itâs good, you're holding my plugs
I dey rhyme right in the lime light
Give us mic, then you see the lame ones
If you don't know what to say, just say my name once
In rap, Iâm the light, Iâm the main line
Continue doubting me, my nigga, even Satan knows the true God
Snooker, black balls are important, so donât give Akosua blue balls
Every day, youâre sleeping, you have become a snail
My flow is tight, Iâm not a waste
Use the fire to cook the good fish
If my verse drops, you will get a hit
They throw shots, but I throw bombs
You stand here, you say far gone
Same book, different authors
Ghana rap, it has nothing to do with stardom
We're pissed already, nobody is pissing us
Usain Bolt, who is chasing us?
My mouth is so precious, so my homie, I can't be kissing ass
Donât come close to me, Zap Mallet height, do you measure Aboagye?
How many teaspoons make one ladle? Rap, if itâs your thing, take it
Naa Sei (hey!)

Come here (swer).
Baby, I want you.
A girl is asking for me.
I take her anywhere and she tells me off.
She says I should give her five thousand.
If a girl is not fine, she canât do it.
But if sheâs nice, itâs 50 (Sosket).
Yes, if sheâs nice, itâs 50.""
Verse: ""Fifteen K for a wig cap.
Something's bothering you.
If itâs day, you sit and rest.
And you keep watching your back.
This year we are serious, we donât pay.
Next week, we donât pay.
I earn 5, 5, 9 a month while you party.
You want this,
You see my waist (Yaa see your waist).
You can take her 10 (Put in the effort and take her 10).
You donât see 2.5.
Do you know something? I give you 1.
Or do you say it's free?
Money finished, I can see clearly.
Wicked mood activated.
What do you want? New hair.
Youâre fine if youâre nice and itâs 50.""
Chorus Repeat: ""Come here, I will take care of you.

Eat from my pocket
And I too eat from ayaase(3x)
My bottom
And I too eat your ayaase
Well done
Listen,
I know you want my cash to take
You want to sleep with my bottom
Iâm letting you know Iâve heard that before
Iâll give you plenty if you play nice
This evening, I met someone in the town
Oseikrom boy, I ride in a taxi
Weâve earned money thatâs worth it
My car can hold two, donât worry
The girls are beautiful, they are something else
You didnât understand that youâre loose when I come around
If I eat Indomie or other food,
Youâve turned your back on the money I have
You spin around 360
You paid for it at 360
My moneyâs going for whisky
When Iâm on you, itâs like whisky
Eat from my pocket
And I too eat it well (3x)
My bottom
And I too eat your ayaase
Well done
(Verse 2 Oseikrom)
Oseikrom,
Mouthful! Mouthful!
The ladies have risen above Tripolis
When thereâs something left to eat
Iâve gained and after that, Iâm tackling better than John Terry
Look at my blue top
I donât do drugs
When Iâm pressed,
Itâs neither loose nor draw
If I spend the night with you,
Iâm in your space
Iâm in your space (3x)
Hear that Iâve spent the night
2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
Iâm with you in your space
Your space
Eat  from my pocket And I too eat your ayaase (3x)
My bottom
And I too eat it well
Well done","HipHop,Asakaa","""Didi Me Botom"" by Ypee featuring Oseikrom Sikanii is a playful and flirtatious song where the artists express confidence and swagger, particularly about their attractiveness and desirability. The chorus emphasizes the enjoyment of physical intimacy, while the verses showcase a mix of bravado about their lifestyle, relationships, and financial success. Overall, the song blends humor with themes of romance and self-assuredness in the context of modern urban life.

Eat from my pocket
And I too eat from ayaase(3x)
My bottom
And I too eat your ayaase
Well done
Listen,
I know you want my cash to take
You want to sleep with my bottom
Iâm letting you know Iâve heard that before
Iâll give you plenty if you play nice
This evening, I met someone in the town
Oseikrom boy, I ride in a taxi
Weâve earned money thatâs worth it
My car can hold two, donât worry
The girls are beautiful, they are something else
You didnât understand that youâre loose when I come around
If I eat Indomie or other food,
Youâve turned your back on the money I have
You spin around 360
You paid for it at 360
My moneyâs going for whisky
When Iâm on you, itâs like whisky
Eat from my pocket
And I too eat it well (3x)
My bottom
And I too eat your ayaase
Well done
(Verse 2 Oseikrom)
Oseikrom,
Mouthful! Mouthful!
The ladies have risen above Tripolis
When thereâs something left to eat
Iâve gained and after that, Iâm tackling better than John Terry
Look at my blue top
I donât do drugs
When Iâm pressed,
Itâs neither loose nor draw
If I spend the night with you,
Iâm in your space
Iâm in your space (3x)
Hear that Iâve spent the night
2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
Iâm with you in your space
Your space
Eat  from my pocket And I too eat your ayaase (3x)
My bottom
And I too eat it well
Well done","HipHop,Asakaa","""Didi Me Botom"" by Ypee featuring Oseikrom Sikanii is a playful and flirtatious song where the artists express confidence and swagger, particularly about their attractiveness and desirability. The chorus emphasizes the enjoyment of physical intimacy, while the verses showcase a mix of bravado about their lifestyle, relationships, and financial success. Overall, the song blends humor with themes of romance and self-assuredness in the context of modern urban life.

Eat from my pocket
And I too eat from ayaase(3x)
My bottom
And I too eat your ayaase
Well done
Listen,
I know you want my cash to take
You want to sleep with my bottom
Iâm letting you know Iâve heard that before
Iâll give you plenty if you play nice
This evening, I met someone in the town
Oseikrom boy, I ride in a taxi
Weâve earned money thatâs worth it
My car can hold two, donât worry
The girls are beautiful, they are something else
You didnât understand that youâre loose when I come around
If I eat Indomie or other food,
Youâve turned your back on the money I have
You spin around 360
You paid for it at 360
My moneyâs going for whisky
When Iâm on you, itâs like whisky
Eat from my pocket
And I too eat it well (3x)
My bottom
And I too eat your ayaase
Well done
(Verse 2 Oseikrom)
Oseikrom,
Mouthful! Mouthful!
The ladies have risen above Tripolis
When thereâs something left to eat
Iâve gained and after that, Iâm tackling better than John Terry
Look at my blue top
I donât do drugs
When Iâm pressed,
Itâs neither loose nor draw
If I spend the night with you,
Iâm in your space
Iâm in your space (3x)
Hear that Iâve spent the night
2. 3. 4. 5. 6.
Iâm with you in your space
Your space
Eat  from my pocket And I too eat your ayaase (3x)
My bottom
And I too eat it well

Listen, today Iâm going to show you Kumerica, itâs not just a tale, itâs physical
You come to Oseikrom and we talk about the issues here, Iâm a playmaker
Let me start with the Breman social media guys, we call it Texas
If you want a town where the game boys make it, itâs Breman; you shouldnât trespass
Where do I come from, and where am I going?
Ebenezer, Iâm heading to Abrepo
There, we are in Georgia where you can buy stuff
At Abrepo Junction, be careful because ladies go there
Dichemso is in West Virginia
In this town, if youâre too bold, they wonât spare you
Only gangsters live there, so if the chairman canât handle it,
Donât take your matters to Manhyia
Manhyia is in Washington DC
Show me the way so I can go to Florida
Look, Iâm saying Bantama is their holiday
If your time is not right, donât act like youâre white
If we go hard, you should know we donât rest
Go around the roundabout, and weâre heading to Miami, Suame boys want to bet on Konami
Kwadaso is in Bronx and Krofrom is in Ohio
Behind Janet and sons, weâre going to hire
In this town, the rich people live like Las Vegas
Ahodwo is where I arrived to play
The players in Kumerica are in Tafo
In California in the morning, theyâre making moves
Ashtown town is what we call New Jersey
Harvis Park morning means everyone wears their Jersey
Water girls mean Adum is where itâs happening
Kejetia, NEW York, I wonât bother you with my thoughts
Kronom, Oklahoma, for the popping
Asaano and Royal View, weâre thinking about ourselves
Amakom, Nebraska, Pankrono, Kentucky
Brokrom, Brooklyn boys, if youâre lucky
Oduom, Alabama, Abuakwa, Chicago
Pz, if youâre holding your phone, itâs Asafo Philadelphia boys are badder
I heard BB KÉso, I brought Mirika
Kumasi Los Angeles with Patase sugar daddies tilapia
Some sell waakye here, but I wonât eat it; I donât want your troubles
You took my girl to go do business
Asu Yeboah, Iâm alone in Indiana
Mississippi atonsu, and I buy marijuana
And many people know Iâm in Massachusetts
Aboabo is where I found my girl Amina
Another cool place is Danyame, Maryland
Old lady jollof and chicken wings, Iâll eat meat
Magazine macro Sundays, one in Michigan
Kumasi is the country, and Iâm a proud Kumerican
Santase, Minnesota, on the road to Volta, it all matters, Opoku Ware, weâre sober
The town center is Asokwa, South Dakota
Iâm heading to Oforikrom, which is like Arizona

If your time is not right, donât act like youâre white
If we go hard, you should know we donât rest
Go around the roundabout, and weâre heading to Miami, Suame boys want to bet on Konami
Kwadaso is in Bronx and Krofrom is in Ohio
Behind Janet and sons, weâre going to hire
In this town, the rich people live like Las Vegas
Ahodwo is where I arrived to play
The players in Kumerica are in Tafo
In California in the morning, theyâre making moves
Ashtown town is what we call New Jersey
Harvis Park morning means everyone wears their Jersey
Water girls mean Adum is where itâs happening
Kejetia, NEW York, I wonât bother you with my thoughts
Kronom, Oklahoma, for the popping
Asaano and Royal View, weâre thinking about ourselves
Amakom, Nebraska, Pankrono, Kentucky
Brokrom, Brooklyn boys, if youâre lucky
Oduom, Alabama, Abuakwa, Chicago
Pz, if youâre holding your phone, itâs Asafo Philadelphia boys are badder
I heard BB KÉso, I brought Mirika
Kumasi Los Angeles with Patase sugar daddies tilapia
Some sell waakye here, but I wonât eat it; I donât want your troubles
You took my girl to go do business
Asu Yeboah, Iâm alone in Indiana
Mississippi atonsu, and I buy marijuana
And many people know Iâm in Massachusetts
Aboabo is where I found my girl Amina
Another cool place is Danyame, Maryland
Old lady jollof and chicken wings, Iâll eat meat
Magazine macro Sundays, one in Michigan
Kumasi is the country, and Iâm a proud Kumerican
Santase, Minnesota, on the road to Volta, it all matters, Opoku Ware, weâre sober
The town center is Asokwa, South Dakota
Iâm heading to Oforikrom, which is like Arizona

Listen, today Iâm going to show you Kumerica, itâs not just a tale, itâs physical
You come to Oseikrom and we talk about the issues here, Iâm a playmaker
Let me start with the Breman social media guys, we call it Texas
If you want a town where the game boys make it, itâs Breman; you shouldnât trespass
Where do I come from, and where am I going?
Ebenezer, Iâm heading to Abrepo
There, we are in Georgia where you can buy stuff
At Abrepo Junction, be careful because ladies go there
Dichemso is in West Virginia
In this town, if youâre too bold, they wonât spare you
Only gangsters live there, so if the chairman canât handle it,
Donât take your matters to Manhyia
Manhyia is in Washington DC
Show me the way so I can go to Florida
Look, Iâm saying Bantama is their holiday
If your time is not right, donât act like youâre white
If we go hard, you should know we donât rest
Go around the roundabout, and weâre heading to Miami, Suame boys want to bet on Konami
