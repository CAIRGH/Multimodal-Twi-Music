And for the one who has found that one and places no one above,
Asem and Kwabena, for the married ones, the ones who vow to love,
This one is for you.
I’m in love with the world, but the fire is burning me,
She showed me love and taught me lessons that made me happy,
So love, this one I do, it’s not hard for me,
Because when you know you’re loved, you feel peace and everything’s alright,
I’m in love, this is why I’m doing this, it’s not hard.
So love, I’m doing this, it’s not hard.
If you know you’re there for me, I’ll wait for you.
I’ll never forget you, you’ve taken my heart and soul with you.
She’s going, I say she’s going,
This is killing me, I say it’s killing me.
I can’t believe she’s leaving, I can’t believe it’s already midnight.
She’s going, I can’t believe we’re at the airport,
I can’t believe she’s about to take off.
She’s leaving on a jet plane,
And I don’t know if she’ll be back again.
And it’s driving me insane,
Though I try to be a man,
It’s not easy for me to watch her go,
Now I know today is never promised tomorrow.
So if you’re leaving, what am I to do?
You’re heading to London while I stay in Accra.
You know when you’re not here, it’s like I’m dead,
You’ve taken my heart and soul with you.
It’s so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
Have you ever been in love so deep,
When you think about her, you can’t sleep?
When you wake up, she’s the air you breathe,
But for some reason, she has to leave.
And you wish there was another way out,
And it hurts so bad, like ouch.
Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,
You are thinking, “How?”
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,
You made her Queen of your heart, you crowned her.
But now she’s got a job offer,
Decision-making is tougher,
You don’t want to be a selfish lover,
So you’ve got to let her go because you love her.
Everybody, put your hands up high,
And wave them from side to side,
If you’ve ever had tears in your eyes,
Because you had to say goodbye.
It’s so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
",Love Poem,"This song by Asem featuring Kwabena Kwabena speaks about the painful experience of a deep love being tested by separation. The singer expresses the difficulty of letting go of a partner who is leaving, possibly for a job opportunity, despite the strong emotional bond they share. There is a mixture of love, regret, and acceptance as the singer reflects on the love they have for the person and the heartbreak of having to say goodbye. The lyrics convey the internal struggle between wanting to keep the loved one close and the selflessness of allowing them to pursue their future. The song highlights the theme of love that endures despite physical distance, with the singer acknowledging that while they must let go, the feelings remain strong.

This is killing me, I say it’s killing me.
I can’t believe she’s leaving, I can’t believe it’s already midnight.
She’s going, I can’t believe we’re at the airport,
I can’t believe she’s about to take off.
She’s leaving on a jet plane,
And I don’t know if she’ll be back again.
And it’s driving me insane,
Though I try to be a man,
It’s not easy for me to watch her go,
Now I know today is never promised tomorrow.
So if you’re leaving, what am I to do?
You’re heading to London while I stay in Accra.
You know when you’re not here, it’s like I’m dead,
You’ve taken my heart and soul with you.
It’s so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
Have you ever been in love so deep,
When you think about her, you can’t sleep?
When you wake up, she’s the air you breathe,
But for some reason, she has to leave.
And you wish there was another way out,
And it hurts so bad, like ouch.
Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,
You are thinking, “How?”
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,
You made her Queen of your heart, you crowned her.
But now she’s got a job offer,
Decision-making is tougher,
You don’t want to be a selfish lover,
So you’ve got to let her go because you love her.
Everybody, put your hands up high,
And wave them from side to side,
If you’ve ever had tears in your eyes,
Because you had to say goodbye.
It’s so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
",Love Poem,"This song by Asem featuring Kwabena Kwabena speaks about the painful experience of a deep love being tested by separation. The singer expresses the difficulty of letting go of a partner who is leaving, possibly for a job opportunity, despite the strong emotional bond they share. There is a mixture of love, regret, and acceptance as the singer reflects on the love they have for the person and the heartbreak of having to say goodbye. The lyrics convey the internal struggle between wanting to keep the loved one close and the selflessness of allowing them to pursue their future. The song highlights the theme of love that endures despite physical distance, with the singer acknowledging that while they must let go, the feelings remain strong.

You are thinking, “How?”
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,
You made her Queen of your heart, you crowned her.
But now she’s got a job offer,
Decision-making is tougher,
You don’t want to be a selfish lover,
So you’ve got to let her go because you love her.
Everybody, put your hands up high,
And wave them from side to side,
If you’ve ever had tears in your eyes,
Because you had to say goodbye.
It’s so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
",Love Poem,"This song by Asem featuring Kwabena Kwabena speaks about the painful experience of a deep love being tested by separation. The singer expresses the difficulty of letting go of a partner who is leaving, possibly for a job opportunity, despite the strong emotional bond they share. There is a mixture of love, regret, and acceptance as the singer reflects on the love they have for the person and the heartbreak of having to say goodbye. The lyrics convey the internal struggle between wanting to keep the loved one close and the selflessness of allowing them to pursue their future. The song highlights the theme of love that endures despite physical distance, with the singer acknowledging that while they must let go, the feelings remain strong.

And for the one who has found that one and places no one above,
Asem and Kwabena, for the married ones, the ones who vow to love,
This one is for you.
I’m in love with the world, but the fire is burning me,
She showed me love and taught me lessons that made me happy,
So love, this one I do, it’s not hard for me,
Because when you know you’re loved, you feel peace and everything’s alright,
I’m in love, this is why I’m doing this, it’s not hard.
So love, I’m doing this, it’s not hard.
If you know you’re there for me, I’ll wait for you.
I’ll never forget you, you’ve taken my heart and soul with you.
She’s going, I say she’s going,
This is killing me, I say it’s killing me.
I can’t believe she’s leaving, I can’t believe it’s already midnight.
She’s going, I can’t believe we’re at the airport,
I can’t believe she’s about to take off.
She’s leaving on a jet plane,
And I don’t know if she’ll be back again.
And it’s driving me insane,
Though I try to be a man,
It’s not easy for me to watch her go,
Now I know today is never promised tomorrow.
So if you’re leaving, what am I to do?
You’re heading to London while I stay in Accra.
You know when you’re not here, it’s like I’m dead,
You’ve taken my heart and soul with you.
It’s so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
Have you ever been in love so deep,
When you think about her, you can’t sleep?
When you wake up, she’s the air you breathe,
But for some reason, she has to leave.
And you wish there was another way out,
And it hurts so bad, like ouch.
Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,

Has made me crazy

It’s like I'm drinking kerosene
Baby, Baby
You’ve got me hooked, leave me
I am the cloth that wraps you
I’ll be the one to cover you forever

When water touches your body
It makes the skin even more attractive
The evening is near, but the game of love remains
Love, eeh, love when I’m with you, I feel it
I don’t want to play around, I love you, eeh
If you keep yourself beautiful
And it’s worth it, I’ll give you my all
You’re my number one
No doubt about it

""One day, you will know,"" these are the words of my mother.

He told me he was a banker, not knowing he's a bank robber.
This man is a gangster, Bukom Banku, boxer.
He wakes up in the morning, working out.
When it's evening, only shockers and ganja are left.

You used to warn me, but I didn't wanna know.
Maame, hwɛ
Maame, hwɛ o, Maame, hwɛ
Maame, hwɛ o, Maame, hwɛ
Maame, hwɛ o
Look at what the servant is doing to me.
I hate you so much right now.
I hate you so much right now.
I hate you so much right now.
I hate you so much right now.
""One day, you will know,"" these are the words of my mother.
As I'm getting older, now I remember.
So I'm packing all my tools, I'm going back home.
A young girl like me shouldn't be caught with an old-schooled fool.
He told me he was a banker, not knowing he's a bank robber.
This man is a gangster, Bukom Banku, boxer.
Now he beats me every night and day.
Maame, hwɛ
You used to warn me, but I didn't wanna know.
Maame, hwɛ
Maame, hwɛ o, Maame, hwɛ
Maame, hwɛ o, Maame, hwɛ

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now

RuffTown Records",Love Poem,"The song expresses the pain and frustration of a woman who was warned by her mother about a toxic relationship. She finds herself in a difficult situation, realizing that the man she loved is abusive and dishonest. The repetitive phrase ""I hate you so much right now"" reflects her feelings of betrayal and heartbreak."

See, I’ve got myself a sponsor
Anything I ask, they buy for me
Even though he is older,
Well, I’ve got to suffer in this life.
Another one who is younger,
When I ask for something, he cries.
When I see this man, I get something to eat—my mother always said so.
When the night falls, you’ll see and know that it’s going to be my turn.
I’ll lie down in the bed and tell him that the way he talks to me is wrong.
Cool it for me, slow down,

A boyfriend who can buy you food when you're hungry—
Is that really a boyfriend?
So I change the game, move fast, switch lanes.
I got myself a sponsor.
When I see this man, I get something to eat—my mother always said so.
When the night falls, you’ll see and know that it’s going to be my turn.
I’ll lie down in the bed and tell him that the way he talks to me is wrong.
Cool it for me, slow down,

Someone show me what I don’t have.

See, I’ve got myself a sponsor
Anything I ask, they buy for me
Even though he is older,
Well, I’ve got to suffer in this life.
Another one who is younger,
When I ask for something, he cries.
When I see this man, I get something to eat—my mother always said so.
When the night falls, you’ll see and know that it’s going to be my turn.
I’ll lie down in the bed and tell him that the way he talks to me is wrong.
Cool it for me, slow down,
Me sisi yε mi ya
Eeeya, Cool it for me, slow down,
Me koti εyε mi ya
Honey, Cool it for me, slow down,
Me sisi yε mi ya
Eeeya, Cool it for me, slow down,

Oh Lord, have mercy, mercy, mercy.
These broke guys have a lot of energy.
In my downtown, it’s hot, just like an oven.
But when the morning comes, I have nothing.
A boyfriend who can buy you food when you're hungry—
Is that really a boyfriend?
So I change the game, move fast, switch lanes.
I got myself a sponsor.
When I see this man, I get something to eat—my mother always said so.

Oh Lord, have mercy, mercy, mercy.
These broke guys have a lot of energy.
Should I leave all these Gucci and Prada?
And which young girl doesn’t fear hunger?
It's a dilemma, I’m a bad girl, Ebony in a dilemma.
Girl, hot, hot girl, hot.
Someone show me what I don’t have.

You know the name right, E.F.Y.A
When the morning sun sweeps across my room,
As I awaken from another dream of you.
You’re staring at me,
Giving me a kiss, saying ""honey"" (honey).
Playing me a song, super melody (melody).
I ask myself, what kind of love is this? This is God's gift
This is something everlasting.
You came along when I was nobody (nobody),
Then showed me how to be somebody (somebody).

My love, Moesha, I miss you greatly
God help me to avoid bad things
When I mention your name, I remember a lot
It was a long time ago
Still can’t believe why I let you go!
It was a mistake, but I know
When I love, the pain is very real
I have my doubts that make me sad
Now I know your love was so divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Don’t know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you; that’s the fact
And your memory will always be cherished
Your love keeps haunting me (haunting me)
I will forever remember the good times
The way you treated me (treated me)
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry
When I hear news that concerns you
It’s enough to make one’s heart ache
Pretty love, they call me on my mobile phone
Let's talk, but you don’t say much at all

Tell me what I should do to win you back, oh

I feel like I shouldn’t do this

My dear, I love you, don’t hold my mistakes against me
Even though I’m standing alone, don’t look down on me
My body has accepted this and I have no shame
If my mate doesn’t love me, no one should love me
I mean I’ve said what I have to, whether you and I have broken up or not
But because of what I used to do to you, it hurts
Late at night, I go to bed and remember
The pain of being without you is worth it
It’s not me; it’s you who holds my heart
It’s not you; it’s me who admires you so
Moesha, if you see me and don’t talk to me
And if someone puts their hands on you 
You still look at me and show your love
Then things will be better overall 
I have been waiting for you, I only exist for you
I have lost you

My love, Moesha, I miss you greatly
God help me to avoid bad things
When I mention your name, I remember a lot
It was a long time ago
Still can’t believe why I let you go!
It was a mistake, but I know
When I love, the pain is very real
I have my doubts that make me sad
Now I know your love was so divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Don’t know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you; that’s the fact
And your memory will always be cherished
Your love keeps haunting me (haunting me)
I will forever remember the good times
The way you treated me (treated me)
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry
When I hear news that concerns you
It’s enough to make one’s heart ache
Pretty love, they call me on my mobile phone
Let's talk, but you don’t say much at all
This ringtone makes me remind you
Let’s talk, but you don’t say much at all

Moesha, Moesha, I love you, my good girl
Moesha, Moesha, I love you, bring back the flavor
Tell me what I should do to win you back
Tell me what I should do to win you back, oh
And I would do anything it takes to revive your love
I feel like I shouldn’t do this
But the love, oh

Even though I’m standing alone, don’t look down on me
My body has accepted this and I have no shame
If my mate doesn’t love me, no one should love me
I mean I’ve said what I have to, whether you and I have broken up or not
But because of what I used to do to you, it hurts
Late at night, I go to bed and remember
The pain of being without you is worth it
It’s not me; it’s you who holds my heart
It’s not you; it’s me who admires you so
Moesha, if you see me and don’t talk to me
And if someone puts their hands on you 
You still look at me and show your love
Then things will be better overall

Verse 2, Obrafour
Okay, listen,
Ohemaa (queen), she is beautiful,
Her humility alone makes me fall for her,
Did you know I proposed to her right away?
I told her to let me place the crown in her heart,
She agreed without hesitation,
So, I’ve asked her to be with me forever.
I don’t want breakups; they bring no honor.
I also don’t want to display her love for show.
I’m filled with joy,
When I see her, even my sadness fades.
I’m not holding back,
A brand new car with a registration number, I’ll give her a ride and show her around,
They say it’s best to keep your partner close,
Angels surround her,
Don’t leave the home empty of her presence,
When that day comes, I’ll celebrate our union.
With a ring on it,
We’ll sign, and I’ll be yours,
If a great pastor blesses us,
That’s when I’ll know our love is sealed, fully complete.

Okay, listen,
Ohemaa (queen), she is beautiful,

So, I’ve asked her to be with me forever.

Who is this, who is this, who is this
I’ve seen a girl who’s caught me off guard
I’ve seen a girl who’s surprised me
Look at her eyes, look at her lips
Look at her eyes, look at her lips
I met this girl during a trip
She was at a place, and I saw her
There she was, wearing her mini-skirt
It’s just her and her mini-skirt
We’ll have a child together, we’ll have a child
We’ll have a child together
Let’s make a pledge, a pledge, a pledge
Let’s commit to each other
You and I will have a child together
We’ll have a child
We’ll name her Emmanuela
Emmanuela, Emmanuela
This love, God is in it

I love this love
Hmm, my dear one, I have found joy
I love this love
I want to tell the world that
Akua Ohenewaa is my queen
Akua Ohenewaa is my queen
Your love is consuming me
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it
Your love is overwhelming me
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it
It’s as if it binds me tightly
Your love is enveloping me

Kwame (Kwame), here I come (here I come)
The beat drops, drops, drops
The rhythm keeps flowing like a river
Her lips are alluring, I miss her tonight
Her lips are tempting, I miss her tonight
Anytime, I love the dark shade
This one, that’s what I like
My African girl
Anytime, I love the dark shade
This one, that’s what I like
My African girl
My, my girlie, girlie
My, my lady, lady
My, my girlie, girlie
My, my lady, lady
You are my dancehall, angel, and baby girl
So come and rock on, the dancehall and my body
You are my dancehall, angel, and baby girl
So come and rock on, the dancehall and my body
I proclaim her, she’s my baby girl
You’re the one I love, and I want you
And I also need you
When we’re close, I feel we’ll be together forever
No one can come between us
She’s beside me, holding me, staying with me
If I need Barosky, I’ll reach out to you
My, my girlie, girlie
My, my lady, lady
My, my girlie, girlie
My, my lady, lady
You and I, together, like gari and sugar
Let’s make it sweet
Let’s hold on to each other tightly
We’ll keep it strong

Oh na na na eh
King King Promise
When it feels like it’s all weighing on me
It shows that this queen is truly mine
Early morning when you rest your head on me
Lean on me with confidence, and I'm all yours
In the dark, it’s just the two of us
Everyone else fades away
Just you and me holding close
It’s us against the world
Ever since you came my way
I’ve never felt this way before, before, before
No worries, I’ll hold you tight
I keep your heart, girl
I’ll never let you go
Come on
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought I’d fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi o
Haah
What else obidiponbidi
Listen
I can see my girl from the driveway
She wants me, and I want her too—what can I say
Anything we do, we do it our way
How many times we’ve kissed all day
Even the people in Germany would say “sheisse” (wow)
When I see her, I’m amazed
She’s been with me from nothing to payday
My love, my queen
Girl, I want a kiss
Can you give it to me just like that
Let’s go shopping and forget the prices
When I’m close to you, I feel transformed
My heart races for you, it’s like a crisis
But I’m so happy with you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life
Listen to the song I sing
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought I’d fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi o
Haah
Listen
Girl, you’ve got a great body and a sweet face
True love walking on the beach
Day and night, by your side
Our connection is always on, never like prepaid
You deserve all the Gucci and Balmain
It’s not only me who loves you—everyone admires you
Love me passionately like Shaolin
Tonight, I’ll play my violin for you
My girl loves the way I am
She says I’m exciting
Girl, your body is enticing
I’m holding on tight, wanting it sweet
Take care of my heart, and I’ll be watching over you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life

Girl, I want a kiss
Can you give it to me just like that
Let’s go shopping and forget the prices
When I’m close to you, I feel transformed
My heart races for you, it’s like a crisis
But I’m so happy with you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life
Listen to the song I sing

Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought I’d fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi o
Haah
Listen
Girl, you’ve got a great body and a sweet face
True love walking on the beach
Day and night, by your side
Our connection is always on, never like prepaid
You deserve all the Gucci and Balmain
It’s not only me who loves you—everyone admires you
Love me passionately like Shaolin
Tonight, I’ll play my violin for you
My girl loves the way I am
She says I’m exciting
Girl, your body is enticing
I’m holding on tight, wanting it sweet
Take care of my heart, and I’ll be watching over you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life

Everyone else fades away
Just you and me holding close
It’s us against the world

Anything we do, we do it our way
How many times we’ve kissed all day
Even the people in Germany would say “sheisse” (wow)
When I see her, I’m amazed
She’s been with me from nothing to payday
My love, my queen
Girl, I want a kiss
Can you give it to me just like that
Let’s go shopping and forget the prices
When I’m close to you, I feel transformed
My heart races for you, it’s like a crisis
But I’m so happy with you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life
Listen to the song I sing
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought I’d fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi o
Haah
Listen
Girl, you’ve got a great body and a sweet face
True love walking on the beach
Day and night, by your side
Our connection is always on, never like prepaid
You deserve all the Gucci and Balmain
It’s not only me who loves you—everyone admires you
Love me passionately like Shaolin
Tonight, I’ll play my violin for you
My girl loves the way I am
She says I’m exciting
Girl, your body is enticing
I’m holding on tight, wanting it sweet
Take care of my heart, and I’ll be watching over you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life
Listen to the song I sing
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought I’d fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi o
Ever since you came my way
I’ve never felt this way before, before, before
No worries, I’ll hold you tight
I keep your heart, girl
I’ll never let you go
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought I’d fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi o
One love

I sing for your body oo
Baby, mad for your body oo (obidiponbidi)

Verse 1
Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and let’s stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart

Verse 2
Listen, yeah
See, my baby makes me realize
That the groupies and side chicks are all lies
They wear bikinis intentionally to show their thighs
But nobody compares to my baby because they’re low-price
My girl’s body even makes guys call her “Tundra”
And her body fits perfectly
Like Daddy Lumba’s lyrics
If I could touch her, I’d be holding on forever
I even have a carpenter at my place because every night my bed breaks
Yeah, some guys try to act wise
That’s why I stay focused
Following me like a uniform
Even when I’m private, she’s there like a backpack
Because there are guys I can’t trust, so I stand firm

Yeah, you see the way you give me perfect love
If you give it to me tonight, I’ll sleep so well
I want to marry you, so I break down prayer walls
Let me lock you down because there’s too much gossip
My testimony is meeting you was a blessing
Even if I wasn’t your type
You took me seriously; a local rapper isn’t your type
(No!)
What you have isn’t just money, it isn’t just hype
They just want you for being like Davido, Olamide, and Ice
Finally, you satisfied my soul like the Holy Ghost
Yesterday I was a copper, today I’m gold
Yeah, it took me so long to get you
Now that I have you
I’ll never let you go, I swear by Allah

Let me lock you down because there’s too much gossip
My testimony is meeting you was a blessing
Even if I wasn’t your type
You took me seriously; a local rapper isn’t your type
(No!)
What you have isn’t just money, it isn’t just hype
They just want you for being like Davido, Olamide, and Ice
Finally, you satisfied my soul like the Holy Ghost
Yesterday I was a copper, today I’m gold
Yeah, it took me so long to get you
Now that I have you
I’ll never let you go, I swear by Allah
Chorus
Baby, mad for your body oo (obidiponbidi)
I'm crazy for your body oo
I sing for your body oo, sing for my honey oo
My lady, mad for your body oo
I'm crazy for your body eeh eh
Anything for your body oo
Outro
Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart, oh, key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and let’s stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart

Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and let’s stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart

Verse 2
Listen, yeah
See, my baby makes me realize
That the groupies and side chicks are all lies
They wear bikinis intentionally to show their thighs
But nobody compares to my baby because they’re low-price
My girl’s body even makes guys call her “Tundra”
And her body fits perfectly
Like Daddy Lumba’s lyrics
If I could touch her, I’d be holding on forever
I even have a carpenter at my place because every night my bed breaks
Yeah, some guys try to act wise
That’s why I stay focused
Following me like a uniform
Even when I’m private, she’s there like a backpack
Because there are guys I can’t trust, so I stand firm
You agree, right?
Chorus
Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and let’s stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart
Verse 16
Yeah, you see the way you give me perfect love
If you give it to me tonight, I’ll sleep so well
I want to marry you, so I break down prayer walls
