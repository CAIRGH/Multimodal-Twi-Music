Stop worrying

I canât believe I canât take control of myself, baby
My heart beats bang bang bang
Should I call you or leave you to go?
Then Iâll be left to cry, baby
If it were the usual âMr. Playboy,â
It would have been different when I met a woman who makes my heart beat bang bang bang
But this feeling is so different
What reason will I give my heart if I should let you go, babe
âCause I wanna know you
So, sweetie, I want us to have a little chat
For so long, up until today
All thatâs in my heart is that
I do love you, ooh baby
Wanna marry you
Canât live without you
âCause youâre the one (yeah)
You are the only one (yeah)
You are my diamond girl
I wanna be with you forever
Forever
I wonder if your father was a saint
âCause someone stole the stars from the sky
And put them in your eyes
Girl, Iâm not saying things just to flatter you
But every bit of what I say comes from within my heart
If you think Iâm lying
Then just look and see for yourself, itâs clear and transparent
Take your hand, touch my heart, and see whatâs there
I wouldnât have told you otherwise
But I can say this much and Iâm confident about it
What reason would I have given my heart
If I had let you go, baby
âCause I know I love you, I know I love you
So, sweetie, I can end our chat with this
What I need is for you to consider this
So I can do the things that bring happiness because
I do love you, ooh baby
Girl, I wanna marry you
Hmmm, canât live without you
Hmmm, âcause youâre the one (yeah)
You are the only one (yeah)
You are my diamond girl
I wanna be with you forever
I canât stop thinking about you every day
I could spend each night dreaming only of you
So please, give me a chance
And let nothing come between us
âCause girl, I wanna spend the rest of my life with you
I do love you, ooh baby
Wanna marry you
(I want, I wanna marry you girl)
Canât live without you
You are the only one (yeah)
You are my diamond girl
I wanna be with you forever
I do love you, ooh baby
(âCause girl, you know I love you)
Wanna marry you
(I wanna marry you)
Canât live without you
Oh, oh, youâre the one
You are the only one
âCause youâre the one
I do love you
Wanna marry you

You are the only one

And for the one who has found that one and places no one above,
Asem and Kwabena, for the married ones, the ones who vow to love,
This one is for you.
Iâm in love with the world, but the fire is burning me,
She showed me love and taught me lessons that made me happy,
So love, this one I do, itâs not hard for me,
Because when you know youâre loved, you feel peace and everythingâs alright,
Iâm in love, this is why Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
So love, Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
If you know youâre there for me, Iâll wait for you.
Iâll never forget you, youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Sheâs going, I say sheâs going,
This is killing me, I say itâs killing me.
I canât believe sheâs leaving, I canât believe itâs already midnight.
Sheâs going, I canât believe weâre at the airport,
I canât believe sheâs about to take off.
Sheâs leaving on a jet plane,
And I donât know if sheâll be back again.
And itâs driving me insane,
Though I try to be a man,
Itâs not easy for me to watch her go,
Now I know today is never promised tomorrow.
So if youâre leaving, what am I to do?
Youâre heading to London while I stay in Accra.
You know when youâre not here, itâs like Iâm dead,
Youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
Have you ever been in love so deep,
When you think about her, you canât sleep?
When you wake up, sheâs the air you breathe,
But for some reason, she has to leave.
And you wish there was another way out,
And it hurts so bad, like ouch.
Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,
You are thinking, âHow?â
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,
You made her Queen of your heart, you crowned her.
But now sheâs got a job offer,
Decision-making is tougher,
You donât want to be a selfish lover,
So youâve got to let her go because you love her.
Everybody, put your hands up high,
And wave them from side to side,
If youâve ever had tears in your eyes,
Because you had to say goodbye.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
",Love Poem,"This song by Asem featuring Kwabena Kwabena speaks about the painful experience of a deep love being tested by separation. The singer expresses the difficulty of letting go of a partner who is leaving, possibly for a job opportunity, despite the strong emotional bond they share. There is a mixture of love, regret, and acceptance as the singer reflects on the love they have for the person and the heartbreak of having to say goodbye. The lyrics convey the internal struggle between wanting to keep the loved one close and the selflessness of allowing them to pursue their future. The song highlights the theme of love that endures despite physical distance, with the singer acknowledging that while they must let go, the feelings remain strong.

And for the one who has found that one and places no one above,
Asem and Kwabena, for the married ones, the ones who vow to love,
This one is for you.
Iâm in love with the world, but the fire is burning me,
She showed me love and taught me lessons that made me happy,
So love, this one I do, itâs not hard for me,
Because when you know youâre loved, you feel peace and everythingâs alright,
Iâm in love, this is why Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
So love, Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
If you know youâre there for me, Iâll wait for you.
Iâll never forget you, youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Sheâs going, I say sheâs going,
This is killing me, I say itâs killing me.
I canât believe sheâs leaving, I canât believe itâs already midnight.
Sheâs going, I canât believe weâre at the airport,
I canât believe sheâs about to take off.
Sheâs leaving on a jet plane,
And I donât know if sheâll be back again.
And itâs driving me insane,
Though I try to be a man,
Itâs not easy for me to watch her go,
Now I know today is never promised tomorrow.
So if youâre leaving, what am I to do?
Youâre heading to London while I stay in Accra.
You know when youâre not here, itâs like Iâm dead,
Youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
Have you ever been in love so deep,
When you think about her, you canât sleep?
When you wake up, sheâs the air you breathe,
But for some reason, she has to leave.
And you wish there was another way out,
And it hurts so bad, like ouch.
Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,
You are thinking, âHow?â
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,
You made her Queen of your heart, you crowned her.
But now sheâs got a job offer,
Decision-making is tougher,
You donât want to be a selfish lover,
So youâve got to let her go because you love her.
Everybody, put your hands up high,
And wave them from side to side,
If youâve ever had tears in your eyes,
Because you had to say goodbye.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
",Love Poem,"This song by Asem featuring Kwabena Kwabena speaks about the painful experience of a deep love being tested by separation. The singer expresses the difficulty of letting go of a partner who is leaving, possibly for a job opportunity, despite the strong emotional bond they share. There is a mixture of love, regret, and acceptance as the singer reflects on the love they have for the person and the heartbreak of having to say goodbye. The lyrics convey the internal struggle between wanting to keep the loved one close and the selflessness of allowing them to pursue their future. The song highlights the theme of love that endures despite physical distance, with the singer acknowledging that while they must let go, the feelings remain strong.

And for the one who has found that one and places no one above,
Asem and Kwabena, for the married ones, the ones who vow to love,
This one is for you.
Iâm in love with the world, but the fire is burning me,
She showed me love and taught me lessons that made me happy,
So love, this one I do, itâs not hard for me,
Because when you know youâre loved, you feel peace and everythingâs alright,
Iâm in love, this is why Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
So love, Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
If you know youâre there for me, Iâll wait for you.
Iâll never forget you, youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Sheâs going, I say sheâs going,
This is killing me, I say itâs killing me.
I canât believe sheâs leaving, I canât believe itâs already midnight.
Sheâs going, I canât believe weâre at the airport,
I canât believe sheâs about to take off.
Sheâs leaving on a jet plane,
And I donât know if sheâll be back again.
And itâs driving me insane,
Though I try to be a man,
Itâs not easy for me to watch her go,
Now I know today is never promised tomorrow.
So if youâre leaving, what am I to do?
Youâre heading to London while I stay in Accra.
You know when youâre not here, itâs like Iâm dead,
Youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
Have you ever been in love so deep,
When you think about her, you canât sleep?
When you wake up, sheâs the air you breathe,
But for some reason, she has to leave.
And you wish there was another way out,
And it hurts so bad, like ouch.
Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,
You are thinking, âHow?â
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,
You made her Queen of your heart, you crowned her.
But now sheâs got a job offer,
Decision-making is tougher,
You donât want to be a selfish lover,
So youâve got to let her go because you love her.
Everybody, put your hands up high,
And wave them from side to side,
If youâve ever had tears in your eyes,
Because you had to say goodbye.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.

And for the one who has found that one and places no one above,
Asem and Kwabena, for the married ones, the ones who vow to love,
This one is for you.
Iâm in love with the world, but the fire is burning me,
She showed me love and taught me lessons that made me happy,
So love, this one I do, itâs not hard for me,
Because when you know youâre loved, you feel peace and everythingâs alright,
Iâm in love, this is why Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
So love, Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
If you know youâre there for me, Iâll wait for you.
Iâll never forget you, youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Sheâs going, I say sheâs going,
This is killing me, I say itâs killing me.
I canât believe sheâs leaving, I canât believe itâs already midnight.
Sheâs going, I canât believe weâre at the airport,
I canât believe sheâs about to take off.
Sheâs leaving on a jet plane,
And I donât know if sheâll be back again.
And itâs driving me insane,
Though I try to be a man,
Itâs not easy for me to watch her go,
Now I know today is never promised tomorrow.
So if youâre leaving, what am I to do?
Youâre heading to London while I stay in Accra.
You know when youâre not here, itâs like Iâm dead,
Youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
Have you ever been in love so deep,
When you think about her, you canât sleep?
When you wake up, sheâs the air you breathe,
But for some reason, she has to leave.
And you wish there was another way out,
And it hurts so bad, like ouch.
Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,
You are thinking, âHow?â
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,
You made her Queen of your heart, you crowned her.
But now sheâs got a job offer,
Decision-making is tougher,
You donât want to be a selfish lover,
So youâve got to let her go because you love her.
Everybody, put your hands up high,
And wave them from side to side,
If youâve ever had tears in your eyes,
Because you had to say goodbye.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.

Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,
You are thinking, âHow?â
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,
You made her Queen of your heart, you crowned her.
But now sheâs got a job offer,
Decision-making is tougher,
You donât want to be a selfish lover,
So youâve got to let her go because you love her.
Everybody, put your hands up high,
And wave them from side to side,
If youâve ever had tears in your eyes,
Because you had to say goodbye.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
",Love Poem,"This song by Asem featuring Kwabena Kwabena speaks about the painful experience of a deep love being tested by separation. The singer expresses the difficulty of letting go of a partner who is leaving, possibly for a job opportunity, despite the strong emotional bond they share. There is a mixture of love, regret, and acceptance as the singer reflects on the love they have for the person and the heartbreak of having to say goodbye. The lyrics convey the internal struggle between wanting to keep the loved one close and the selflessness of allowing them to pursue their future. The song highlights the theme of love that endures despite physical distance, with the singer acknowledging that while they must let go, the feelings remain strong.

And for the one who has found that one and places no one above,
Asem and Kwabena, for the married ones, the ones who vow to love,
This one is for you.
Iâm in love with the world, but the fire is burning me,
She showed me love and taught me lessons that made me happy,
So love, this one I do, itâs not hard for me,
Because when you know youâre loved, you feel peace and everythingâs alright,
Iâm in love, this is why Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
So love, Iâm doing this, itâs not hard.
If you know youâre there for me, Iâll wait for you.
Iâll never forget you, youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Sheâs going, I say sheâs going,
This is killing me, I say itâs killing me.
I canât believe sheâs leaving, I canât believe itâs already midnight.
Sheâs going, I canât believe weâre at the airport,
I canât believe sheâs about to take off.
Sheâs leaving on a jet plane,
And I donât know if sheâll be back again.
And itâs driving me insane,
Though I try to be a man,
Itâs not easy for me to watch her go,
Now I know today is never promised tomorrow.
So if youâre leaving, what am I to do?
Youâre heading to London while I stay in Accra.
You know when youâre not here, itâs like Iâm dead,
Youâve taken my heart and soul with you.
Itâs so hard to say bye-bye,
I love you, but when will you return?
I cry so much, tears everywhere,
The rain is like tears, tears everywhere.
Have you ever been in love so deep,
When you think about her, you canât sleep?
When you wake up, sheâs the air you breathe,
But for some reason, she has to leave.
And you wish there was another way out,
And it hurts so bad, like ouch.
Now you have to live without her, and like Michael Bolton,
You are thinking, âHow?â
Because your world revolves around her,
And ever since the day you found her,

If you left me standing at a crossroad,
And at night when you leave, I will still wait for you.
Even if I pull away from you,
Itâs clear that I still care.
Someone will comfort me,
[Someone will comfort me and ease my pain],
Theyâll give me some hope when I am down,
And give me money to make it easier,
Look, why didnât you say this earlier?
Someone will comfort me and ease my pain,
If you had said this before, I wouldnât be feeling this way.
And give me money to make it easier.
Someone will come and help me,
But it would hurt me if you donât show that you care.
If youâre really sorry, then make amends,
And Iâll forgive you for everything.
You know Iâll never forget you,
No matter how much I cry, Iâll always care.
When I made mistakes, I learned and tried to do better,
Even if I donât understand everything, Iâll try to learn,
I donât want to cause you pain anymore,
Iâll admit my wrongs, and hope we can move forward.
If you hurt me, Iâll learn from it,
But if you walk away, please donât act like it never mattered.",Love Poem,"The song expresses deep emotional turmoil and confusion due to a troubled relationship. The singer grapples with feelings of hurt, longing, and betrayal, yet seeks comfort and reconciliation.

My heart feels trapped, itâs hard to breathe,
I feel like I canât take it anymore, but why is this happening?
My spirit wants to leave my body, but I canât explain it.
Someone is hurting me,
When Iâm in a difficult situation, your face appears, but disappears later.
Someone will comfort me,
Someone will comfort me and ease my pain,
Theyâll give me some hope when I am down,
[And give me money to make it easier],
Look, why didnât you say this earlier?
Someone will comfort me and ease my pain,
If you had said this before, I wouldn't be feeling this way.
And give me money to make it easier.
With just a little, a little money, a little time,
If you didnât have anything and still gave me something, Iâd be happy.
You know Iâm not a stranger to hardship,
So make me happy by giving me something,
I am asking for something from you,
If you donât want me, just leave me.
But if you leave, donât act as though we never existed.
I know hardship, Iâve been through so much,
But my heart still hopes for you,
Even though my body is hurting, Iâll still carry on.
If you left me standing at a crossroad,
And at night when you leave, I will still wait for you.
Even if I pull away from you,
Itâs clear that I still care.
Someone will comfort me,
[Someone will comfort me and ease my pain],
Theyâll give me some hope when I am down,
And give me money to make it easier,
Look, why didnât you say this earlier?
Someone will comfort me and ease my pain,
If you had said this before, I wouldnât be feeling this way.
And give me money to make it easier.
Someone will come and help me,
But it would hurt me if you donât show that you care.
If youâre really sorry, then make amends,
And Iâll forgive you for everything.
You know Iâll never forget you,
No matter how much I cry, Iâll always care.
When I made mistakes, I learned and tried to do better,
Even if I donât understand everything, Iâll try to learn,
I donât want to cause you pain anymore,
Iâll admit my wrongs, and hope we can move forward.
If you hurt me, Iâll learn from it,
But if you walk away, please donât act like it never mattered.",Love Poem,"The song expresses deep emotional turmoil and confusion due to a troubled relationship. The singer grapples with feelings of hurt, longing, and betrayal, yet seeks comfort and reconciliation. Despite the pain, there is a desire for understanding and hope for resolution, even if it means learning from the mistakes made.

My life has never been the same,
Since the day you arrived.
I will never ever let you go...
You made my heart and soul feel so good,
You spoke words that have hurt me so much,
You wiped away all my pain,
I wear my crown with pride,
Your love is what sustains me.
You made me so beautiful,
You made my life so meaningful.
Iâve given you my whole heart,
My world revolves around your love.
Youâve given me your hand,
And I can never repay you.
You make me feel happy,
Your love is what fills me with joy.
What I want is what you give me,
But you gave me a reason to let you stay.
My life has never been the same since that day,
I never felt love this special way.
Hereâs the key to my heart,
Take my love away.
You made my heart and soul feel so good,

You spoke words that have hurt me so much,
You wiped away all my pain,
I wear my crown with pride,
Your love is what sustains me.
You made me so beautiful,
You made my life so meaningful.
I feel like I belong,
And I think about myself.
Iâve lost all the things I once had,
But still, I will not give up.
I feel so great, life has so much meaning.
I look for the best in everything.
I wish you knew how much I feel,
But you gave me a reason to let you stay.
My life has never been the same,
Since the day you arrived.
I will never ever let you go...
You made my heart and soul feel so good,
You spoke words that have hurt me so much,
You wiped away all my pain,
I wear my crown with pride,
Your love is what sustains me.
You made me so beautiful,
You made my life so meaningful.
Iâve given you my whole heart,
My world revolves around your love.
Youâve given me your hand,
And I can never repay you.
You make me feel happy,
Your love is what fills me with joy.
What I want is what you give me,
But you gave me a reason to let you stay.
My life has never been the same since that day,
I never felt love this special way.
Hereâs the key to my heart,
Take my love away.
You made my heart and soul feel so good,
You spoke words that have hurt me so much,
You wiped away all my pain,
I wear my crown with pride,
Your love is what sustains me.
You made me so beautiful,
You made my life so meaningful.",Love Poem,"The song is about a deep sense of love and appreciation for someone who has brought joy, meaning, and beauty into the singerâs life.

Look closely and youâll see that Iâm different
Hmm, love, ee ee
You've made my thoughts scatter
The way you touch me
Has made me crazy
I look ahead, and I see the light
Itâs like I'm drinking kerosene
Baby, Baby
Youâve got me hooked, leave me
I am the cloth that wraps you
Iâll be the one to cover you forever
If I were a love carpenter, sokooo
I would make your heart beat with rhythm, sokooo
And show you how to love, yopooo
Weâd enjoy it, oh my lady, yopoooo eei
If I were a love carpenter, sokooo
I would make your heart beat with rhythm, sokooo
And show you how to love, yopooo
Weâd enjoy it, oh my lady, yopoooo eei
We say ""sokoo,"" and women love it
But we have something in common, indeed
The way you do it, I am learning from you
You are like no one else
Love, you make me feel like a balloon
Itâs true that your love is heavy, eei
I canât deny the fact that
Iâve fallen for my angel
If I were a love carpenter, sokooo
I would make your heart beat with rhythm, sokooo
And show you how to love, yopooo
Weâd enjoy it, oh my lady, yopoooo eei
If I were a love carpenter, sokooo
I would make your heart beat with rhythm, sokooo
And show you how to love, yopooo
Weâd enjoy it, oh my lady, yopoooo eei
I feel the lady inside you
You are beautiful, so sweet
When water touches your body
It makes the skin even more attractive
The evening is near, but the game of love remains
Love, eeh, love when Iâm with you, I feel it
I donât want to play around, I love you, eeh
If you keep yourself beautiful
And itâs worth it, Iâll give you my all
Youâre my number one
No doubt about it
Itâs been a while since I felt true love
I canât deny the fact that
Iâve fallen for my angel
If I were a love carpenter, sokooo
I would make your heart beat with rhythm, sokooo
And show you how to love, yopooo
Weâd enjoy it, oh my lady, yopoooo eei
If I were a love carpenter, sokooo
I would make your heart beat with rhythm, sokooo
And show you how to love, yopooo

The artist uses the metaphor of being a ""love carpenter"" to show how they would carefully shape and nurture the relationship. Ultimately, the song celebrates love, affection, and the joy of being in a meaningful, intimate connection with someone special.

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now

""One day, you will know,"" these are the words of my mother.
As I'm getting older, now I remember.
So I'm packing all my tools, I'm going back home.
A young girl like me shouldn't be caught with an old-schooled fool.
He told me he was a banker, not knowing he's a bank robber.
This man is a gangster, Bukom Banku, boxer.
He wakes up in the morning, working out.
When it's evening, only shockers and ganja are left.
Now he beats me every night and day.

Midas Touch
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
""One day, you will know,"" these are the words of my mother.
As I'm getting older, now I remember.
So I'm packing all my tools, I'm going back home.
A young girl like me shouldn't be caught with an old-schooled fool.
He told me he was a banker, not knowing he's a bank robber.
This man is a gangster, Bukom Banku, boxer.
He wakes up in the morning, working out.
When it's evening, only shockers and ganja are left.
Now he beats me every night and day.

Look at what the servant is doing to me.
And the child doesn't listen to mama (or)
The child doesn't listen to papa.
Now the children of today, social media is where they live.
What has happened to good living?
What has happened to true love?
But for the child, when they see a fool, they say it's okay.
He told me he was a banker, not knowing he's a bank robber.

I hate you so much right now

""One day, you will know,"" these are the words of my mother.
As I'm getting older, now I remember.
So I'm packing all my tools, I'm going back home.
A young girl like me shouldn't be caught with an old-schooled fool.
He told me he was a banker, not knowing he's a bank robber.
This man is a gangster, Bukom Banku, boxer.
He wakes up in the morning, working out.
When it's evening, only shockers and ganja are left.
Now he beats me every night and day.

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
""One day, you will know,"" these are the words of my mother.
As I'm getting older, now I remember.
So I'm packing all my tools, I'm going back home.
A young girl like me shouldn't be caught with an old-schooled fool.
He told me he was a banker, not knowing he's a bank robber.
This man is a gangster, Bukom Banku, boxer.
He wakes up in the morning, working out.
When it's evening, only shockers and ganja are left.
Now he beats me every night and day.

The child doesn't listen to papa.
Now the children of today, social media is where they live.
What has happened to good living?
What has happened to true love?
But for the child, when they see a fool, they say it's okay.
He told me he was a banker, not knowing he's a bank robber.

When I see this man, I get something to eatâmy mother always said so.

Through playful yet serious lines, it also portrays her reflection on the choices she's made and the lack of genuine love from her partners.

But when the morning comes, I have nothing.
A boyfriend who can buy you food when you're hungryâ
Is that really a boyfriend?
So I change the game, move fast, switch lanes.
I got myself a sponsor.
When I see this man, I get something to eatâmy mother always said so.
When the night falls, youâll see and know that itâs going to be my turn.
Iâll lie down in the bed and tell him that the way he talks to me is wrong.
Cool it for me, slow down,
Me sisi yÎµ mi ya
Eeeya, Cool it for me, slow down,
Me koti ÎµyÎµ mi ya
Honey, Cool it for me, slow down,
Me sisi yÎµ mi ya
Eeeya, Cool it for me, slow down,
Me koti ÎµyÎµ mi ya
Oh Lord, have mercy, mercy, mercy.
These broke guys have a lot of energy.
Should I leave all these Gucci and Prada?
And which young girl doesnât fear hunger?
It's a dilemma, Iâm a bad girl, Ebony in a dilemma.
Girl, hot, hot girl, hot.
Someone show me what I donât have.
When I see this man, I get something to eatâmy mother always said so.
When the night falls, youâll see and know that itâs going to be my turn.
Iâll lie down in the bed and tell him that the way he talks to me is wrong.

Oh Lord, have mercy, mercy, mercy.",Love Poem,"This song speaks about a woman who has chosen to date older, wealthy men (""sponsors"") to fulfill her material needs, contrasting her current relationship with a younger man who can't afford to provide for her. It highlights the dilemma she faces, torn between superficial desires (like luxury brands) and real relationships. Through playful yet serious lines, it also portrays her reflection on the choices she's made and the lack of genuine love from her partners.

See, Iâve got myself a sponsor
Anything I ask, they buy for me
Even though he is older,
Well, Iâve got to suffer in this life.
Another one who is younger,
When I ask for something, he cries.
When I see this man, I get something to eatâmy mother always said so.
When the night falls, youâll see and know that itâs going to be my turn.
Iâll lie down in the bed and tell him that the way he talks to me is wrong.
Cool it for me, slow down,
Me sisi yÎµ mi ya
Eeeya, Cool it for me, slow down,
Me koti ÎµyÎµ mi ya
Honey, Cool it for me, slow down,

Eeeya, Cool it for me, slow down,

Oh Lord, have mercy, mercy, mercy.
These broke guys have a lot of energy.
In my downtown, itâs hot, just like an oven.
But when the morning comes, I have nothing.
A boyfriend who can buy you food when you're hungryâ
Is that really a boyfriend?
So I change the game, move fast, switch lanes.

Should I leave all these Gucci and Prada?
And which young girl doesnât fear hunger?
It's a dilemma, Iâm a bad girl, Ebony in a dilemma.
Girl, hot, hot girl, hot.
Someone show me what I donât have.

Oh Lord, have mercy, mercy, mercy.",Love Poem,"This song speaks about a woman who has chosen to date older, wealthy men (""sponsors"") to fulfill her material needs, contrasting her current relationship with a younger man who can't afford to provide for her. It highlights the dilemma she faces, torn between superficial desires (like luxury brands) and real relationships. Through playful yet serious lines, it also portrays her reflection on the choices she's made and the lack of genuine love from her partners.

See, Iâve got myself a sponsor
Anything I ask, they buy for me
Even though he is older,
Well, Iâve got to suffer in this life.
Another one who is younger,
When I ask for something, he cries.
When I see this man, I get something to eatâmy mother always said so.
When the night falls, youâll see and know that itâs going to be my turn.
Iâll lie down in the bed and tell him that the way he talks to me is wrong.

These broke guys have a lot of energy.
In my downtown, itâs hot, just like an oven.
But when the morning comes, I have nothing.
A boyfriend who can buy you food when you're hungryâ
Is that really a boyfriend?
So I change the game, move fast, switch lanes.

You know the name right, E.F.Y.A
When the morning sun sweeps across my room,
As I awaken from another dream of you.
Youâre staring at me,
Giving me a kiss, saying ""honey"" (honey).
Playing me a song, super melody (melody).
I ask myself, what kind of love is this? This is God's gift
This is something everlasting.
You came along when I was nobody (nobody),
Then showed me how to be somebody (somebody).
My dear, look at me.
I would die with you, Iâm right here for you.
Because no one is like you, ooo.
My love, my love, my love.
You bring out the best, the best in me.
(You bring out the best in me)
You bring out the best, the best in me.
(You bring out the best in me)
Because of the touch of your hand,
(The touch of your hand)
You bring out the best in me.
A kind of loving, knowing you are my man,
(Know you are my man)
You bring out the best in me, ah yeah.
You bring out the best, the best in me.
(Aahh you bring out the best in me)
You bring out the best, the best in me.
(Aww aww aww aww aww)
Because of the touch of your hand, boy,
(You bring out the best in me)
A kind of loving, knowing you are my man, boy.
(You bring out the best in me)
So every second, every minute, every hour,
You say things that only make me stronger.
You give me the strength to accept
The things I cannot change.
You hold me like I am precious.
So tears will never touch my name.
Every step I take is meaningful,
You look at me like Iâm something beautiful.
You came along when I was no, no, no nobody, baby,
(Nobody, nobody)
Then showed me how to be somebody (somebody).
Oh oh, my dear, look at me.
I would die with you, Iâm right here for you.
Because no one is like you, ooo.
My love, my love, my love.
You bring out the best, the best in me.
(You bring out the best in me)
You bring out the best, the best in me.
(Aww aww aww aww aww)

You know the name right, E.F.Y.A
When the morning sun sweeps across my room,
As I awaken from another dream of you.
Youâre staring at me,
Giving me a kiss, saying ""honey"" (honey).
Playing me a song, super melody (melody).
I ask myself, what kind of love is this? This is God's gift
This is something everlasting.
You came along when I was nobody (nobody),
Then showed me how to be somebody (somebody).
My dear, look at me.
I would die with you, Iâm right here for you.
Because no one is like you, ooo.

You know the name right, E.F.Y.A
When the morning sun sweeps across my room,
As I awaken from another dream of you.
Youâre staring at me,
Giving me a kiss, saying ""honey"" (honey).
Playing me a song, super melody (melody).
I ask myself, what kind of love is this? This is God's gift
This is something everlasting.
You came along when I was nobody (nobody),
Then showed me how to be somebody (somebody).

You know the name right, E.F.Y.A
When the morning sun sweeps across my room,
As I awaken from another dream of you.
Youâre staring at me,
Giving me a kiss, saying ""honey"" (honey).
Playing me a song, super melody (melody).
I ask myself, what kind of love is this? This is God's gift
This is something everlasting.
You came along when I was nobody (nobody),
Then showed me how to be somebody (somebody).
My dear, look at me.
I would die with you, Iâm right here for you.
Because no one is like you, ooo.
My love, my love, my love.
You bring out the best, the best in me.
(You bring out the best in me)
You bring out the best, the best in me.
(You bring out the best in me)
Because of the touch of your hand,
(The touch of your hand)
You bring out the best in me.
A kind of loving, knowing you are my man,
(Know you are my man)
You bring out the best in me, ah yeah.
You bring out the best, the best in me.

Because of the touch of your hand, boy,
(You bring out the best in me)
A kind of loving, knowing you are my man, boy.
(You bring out the best in me)
So every second, every minute, every hour,
You say things that only make me stronger.
You give me the strength to accept
The things I cannot change.
You hold me like I am precious.
So tears will never touch my name.
Every step I take is meaningful,
You look at me like Iâm something beautiful.
You came along when I was no, no, no nobody, baby,
(Nobody, nobody)
Then showed me how to be somebody (somebody).
Oh oh, my dear, look at me.
I would die with you, Iâm right here for you.
Because no one is like you, ooo.
My love, my love, my love.
You bring out the best, the best in me.

The words you say hurt me so much.
It pains me, but it doesn't get to me that much.
Before long, people are tired of each other.
I don't bother too much, but
I also have feelings.
So, when you do things to me, I feel it deeply.
But I don't want to fill myself with anger over you.
Treat me like your brother, eh (eh, eh)
And treat me like your sister, eh (eh, eh)
And make me one of your own (eh) hey (eh)

Help me; I need you right now.
I'm not macaroni or spaghetti.
Blood flows through me, too.
But it's like some people don't even care about others.
This world and the nature of people...
If you die today, tomorrow theyâll play songs.
So love one another, eh.

Take me as one of your siblings, eh.
If I wrong you, forgive me, eh.
Because a person is another person's sibling.
I feel things too; Iâm also a person.
Look into your heart and help me, eh.
If you see me in trouble,
Don't turn your back on me, for I am your sibling, eh.
If I am in need, help me, eh.
When I am down, lift me up, eh.
Please be my brother,
'Cause I could be one of yours, yeah.

It highlights the pain caused by neglect and the importance of helping each other, especially during difficult times. Ultimately, the message is that we should love one another, as tomorrow is uncertain.

I would never find love?
Then it was a dream, baby
A bad dream
Look, wake up
No one told you
That love goes to those who have love
No one, no one told you
I give my whole heart, and they take it all for granted
I tried to be truthful, but truth was ignored
I thought someone else would be enough
But Kojo stayed by my side and held me close
Iâm really gone now, yeah

Ayy, today is fresh, so we launch
He stays indoors, but thoughts smash him
We fight, so he crashes
He tried to resist but can't function
We knock, and the doors are opened
He lives next door, so all lights will be seen
Donât think you can come take what belongs to someone else
If your cocoa is ripe, weâll make Milo
If you say youâre brown, today weâll add you to Nido
You had a hundred, now youâre at zero
Flowking Stone has made me a hero
Captain Planet, I donât like pollution
So if you donât want me around, thereâll never be fusion, true story
You said you had a comfortable lead
Now tell me, whoâs really losing, huh

It explores themes of self-worth, resilience, and the bittersweet realization that true love requires mutual respect and commitment. Ultimately, the singer acknowledges the importance of valuing oneself and moving forward, even when love doesnât turn out as expected.

The message emphasizes loyalty, deep affection, and the readiness to face any challenge together as a couple.

My love, Moesha, I miss you greatly
God help me to avoid bad things
When I mention your name, I remember a lot
It was a long time ago
Still canât believe why I let you go!
It was a mistake, but I know
When I love, the pain is very real
I have my doubts that make me sad
Now I know your love was so divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you; thatâs the fact
And your memory will always be cherished
Your love keeps haunting me (haunting me)
I will forever remember the good times
The way you treated me (treated me)
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry
When I hear news that concerns you
Itâs enough to make oneâs heart ache
Pretty love, they call me on my mobile phone
Let's talk, but you donât say much at all
This ringtone makes me remind you
Letâs talk, but you donât say much at all
This ringtone makes me remind you
Moesha, Moesha, I love you, my good girl
Moesha, Moesha, I love you, bring back the flavor
Tell me what I should do to win you back
Tell me what I should do to win you back, oh
And I would do anything it takes to revive your love
I feel like I shouldnât do this
But the love, oh
Now I know your love was divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you, thatâs the fact
Letâs talk, but you donât say much at all
This ringtone makes me remind you
My dear, I love you, donât hold my mistakes against me
Even though Iâm standing alone, donât look down on me
My body has accepted this and I have no shame
If my mate doesnât love me, no one should love me
I mean Iâve said what I have to, whether you and I have broken up or not
But because of what I used to do to you, it hurts
Late at night, I go to bed and remember
The pain of being without you is worth it
Itâs not me; itâs you who holds my heart
Itâs not you; itâs me who admires you so
Moesha, if you see me and donât talk to me
And if someone puts their hands on you 
You still look at me and show your love
Then things will be better overall 
I have been waiting for you, I only exist for you
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
When I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry

My love, Moesha, I miss you greatly
God help me to avoid bad things
When I mention your name, I remember a lot
It was a long time ago
Still canât believe why I let you go!
It was a mistake, but I know
When I love, the pain is very real
I have my doubts that make me sad
Now I know your love was so divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you; thatâs the fact
And your memory will always be cherished
Your love keeps haunting me (haunting me)
I will forever remember the good times
The way you treated me (treated me)
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry
When I hear news that concerns you

Tell me what I should do to win you back
Tell me what I should do to win you back, oh
And I would do anything it takes to revive your love
I feel like I shouldnât do this

My dear, I love you, donât hold my mistakes against me
Even though Iâm standing alone, donât look down on me
My body has accepted this and I have no shame
If my mate doesnât love me, no one should love me
I mean Iâve said what I have to, whether you and I have broken up or not
But because of what I used to do to you, it hurts
Late at night, I go to bed and remember
The pain of being without you is worth it
Itâs not me; itâs you who holds my heart
Itâs not you; itâs me who admires you so
Moesha, if you see me and donât talk to me
And if someone puts their hands on you 
You still look at me and show your love
Then things will be better overall 
I have been waiting for you, I only exist for you
I have lost you

Now I know your love was so divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you; thatâs the fact
And your memory will always be cherished
Your love keeps haunting me (haunting me)
I will forever remember the good times
The way you treated me (treated me)
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry
When I hear news that concerns you
Itâs enough to make oneâs heart ache
Pretty love, they call me on my mobile phone
Let's talk, but you donât say much at all
This ringtone makes me remind you
Letâs talk, but you donât say much at all
This ringtone makes me remind you
Moesha, Moesha, I love you, my good girl
Moesha, Moesha, I love you, bring back the flavor
Tell me what I should do to win you back
Tell me what I should do to win you back, oh
And I would do anything it takes to revive your love
I feel like I shouldnât do this
But the love, oh
Now I know your love was divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you, thatâs the fact
Letâs talk, but you donât say much at all
This ringtone makes me remind you
My dear, I love you, donât hold my mistakes against me
Even though Iâm standing alone, donât look down on me
My body has accepted this and I have no shame
If my mate doesnât love me, no one should love me
I mean Iâve said what I have to, whether you and I have broken up or not
But because of what I used to do to you, it hurts
Late at night, I go to bed and remember
The pain of being without you is worth it
Itâs not me; itâs you who holds my heart
Itâs not you; itâs me who admires you so
Moesha, if you see me and donât talk to me
And if someone puts their hands on you 
You still look at me and show your love
Then things will be better overall 
I have been waiting for you, I only exist for you
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
When I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry
When I hear news that concerns you
Itâs enough to make oneâs heart ache

My love, Moesha, I miss you greatly
God help me to avoid bad things
When I mention your name, I remember a lot
It was a long time ago
Still canât believe why I let you go!
It was a mistake, but I know
When I love, the pain is very real
I have my doubts that make me sad
Now I know your love was so divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you; thatâs the fact
And your memory will always be cherished
Your love keeps haunting me (haunting me)
I will forever remember the good times
The way you treated me (treated me)
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry
When I hear news that concerns you
Itâs enough to make oneâs heart ache
Pretty love, they call me on my mobile phone

Moesha, Moesha, I love you, my good girl
Moesha, Moesha, I love you, bring back the flavor
Tell me what I should do to win you back
Tell me what I should do to win you back, oh
And I would do anything it takes to revive your love
I feel like I shouldnât do this
But the love, oh
Now I know your love was divine
I wish I could reverse the times of hunger
Donât know what to do to bring you back
I still have love for you, thatâs the fact

This ringtone makes me remind you
My dear, I love you, donât hold my mistakes against me
Even though Iâm standing alone, donât look down on me
My body has accepted this and I have no shame
If my mate doesnât love me, no one should love me
I mean Iâve said what I have to, whether you and I have broken up or not
But because of what I used to do to you, it hurts
Late at night, I go to bed and remember
The pain of being without you is worth it
Itâs not me; itâs you who holds my heart
Itâs not you; itâs me who admires you so
Moesha, if you see me and donât talk to me
And if someone puts their hands on you 
You still look at me and show your love
Then things will be better overall 
I have been waiting for you, I only exist for you
I have lost you
The water has turned to become a barrier
When I remember you so much
That my eyes even cry

Verse 2, Obrafour
Okay, listen,
Ohemaa (queen), she is beautiful,
Her humility alone makes me fall for her,
Did you know I proposed to her right away?
I told her to let me place the crown in her heart,
She agreed without hesitation,
So, Iâve asked her to be with me forever.
I donât want breakups; they bring no honor.
I also donât want to display her love for show.
Iâm filled with joy,
When I see her, even my sadness fades.
Iâm not holding back,
A brand new car with a registration number, Iâll give her a ride and show her around,
They say itâs best to keep your partner close,
Angels surround her,
Donât leave the home empty of her presence,
When that day comes, Iâll celebrate our union.

Verse 2, Obrafour
Okay, listen,
Ohemaa (queen), she is beautiful,
Her humility alone makes me fall for her,
Did you know I proposed to her right away?
I told her to let me place the crown in her heart,
She agreed without hesitation,
So, Iâve asked her to be with me forever.
I donât want breakups; they bring no honor.
I also donât want to display her love for show.
Iâm filled with joy,
When I see her, even my sadness fades.
Iâm not holding back,
A brand new car with a registration number, Iâll give her a ride and show her around,
They say itâs best to keep your partner close,
Angels surround her,
Donât leave the home empty of her presence,
When that day comes, Iâll celebrate our union.
With a ring on it,
Weâll sign, and Iâll be yours,
If a great pastor blesses us,
Thatâs when Iâll know our love is sealed, fully complete.

Verse 1, Obrafour
Hey, for marriage, take me home to meet your family,
Iâll care for you, Iâll adorn you with gold bracelets,
When we love each other, we make the commitment,
You are in my heart, God made it so.
Abenaa, let me put a ring on your finger,
Youâre in my heart, beloved child.

Iâm waiting for the day,
theyâll roll out the carpet for me and you.
Pimpinaa, Abenaa,
Letâs not break up, Abenaa.
Verse 2, Obrafour
Okay, listen,
Ohemaa (queen), she is beautiful,
Her humility alone makes me fall for her,
Did you know I proposed to her right away?
I told her to let me place the crown in her heart,
She agreed without hesitation,
So, Iâve asked her to be with me forever.
I donât want breakups; they bring no honor.
I also donât want to display her love for show.
Iâm filled with joy,
When I see her, even my sadness fades.
Iâm not holding back,
A brand new car with a registration number, Iâll give her a ride and show her around,
They say itâs best to keep your partner close,
Angels surround her,
Donât leave the home empty of her presence,
When that day comes, Iâll celebrate our union.
With a ring on it,
Weâll sign, and Iâll be yours,
If a great pastor blesses us,
Thatâs when Iâll know our love is sealed, fully complete.

Maabenaa, show me kindness,
Let me see your face and smile,
Let me hold your hand home,
Nana, I donât want a breakup,
The Holy Bible is by my side,
Look, if I donât marry you, no one else will,
I mean it, no one else but you, I wonât leave you for anyone else,

Iâve seen a girl whoâs caught me off guard
Iâve seen a girl whoâs surprised me
Look at her eyes, look at her lips
Look at her eyes, look at her lips
I met this girl during a trip
She was at a place, and I saw her
There she was, wearing her mini-skirt
Itâs just her and her mini-skirt
Weâll have a child together, weâll have a child
Weâll have a child together
Letâs make a pledge, a pledge, a pledge
Letâs commit to each other
You and I will have a child together
Weâll have a child
Weâll name her Emmanuela
Emmanuela, Emmanuela
This love, God is in it
Hmm, Emmanuela
Emmanuela, Emmanuela
This love, God is in it
But, love is sweet, love is sweet
When she calls my name, it feels so good
Kwame (Kwame), here I come (here I come)
Kwame (Kwame), here I come (here I come)
Hmm, my dear one, I have found joy
I love this love
Hmm, my dear one, I have found joy
I love this love
I want to tell the world that
Akua Ohenewaa is my queen
Akua Ohenewaa is my queen
Your love is consuming me
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it
Your love is overwhelming me
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it
Itâs as if it binds me tightly
Your love is enveloping me
When she calls my name, it feels so good
Kwame (Kwame), here I come (here I come)
Kwame (Kwame), here I come (here I come)
The beat drops, drops, drops
The rhythm keeps flowing like a river
Her lips are alluring, I miss her tonight
Her lips are tempting, I miss her tonight
Anytime, I love the dark shade
This one, thatâs what I like
My African girl
Anytime, I love the dark shade
This one, thatâs what I like
My African girl
My, my girlie, girlie
My, my lady, lady
My, my girlie, girlie
My, my lady, lady
You are my dancehall, angel, and baby girl
So come and rock on, the dancehall and my body
You are my dancehall, angel, and baby girl
So come and rock on, the dancehall and my body
I proclaim her, sheâs my baby girl
Youâre the one I love, and I want you
And I also need you
When weâre close, I feel weâll be together forever
No one can come between us
Sheâs beside me, holding me, staying with me
If I need Barosky, Iâll reach out to you
My, my girlie, girlie
My, my lady, lady
My, my girlie, girlie
My, my lady, lady
You and I, together, like gari and sugar

Who is this, who is this, who is this
Iâve seen a girl whoâs caught me off guard
Iâve seen a girl whoâs surprised me
Look at her eyes, look at her lips
Look at her eyes, look at her lips
I met this girl during a trip
She was at a place, and I saw her
There she was, wearing her mini-skirt
Itâs just her and her mini-skirt
Weâll have a child together, weâll have a child
Weâll have a child together
Letâs make a pledge, a pledge, a pledge

Akua Ohenewaa is my queen
Akua Ohenewaa is my queen
Your love is consuming me
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it

I feel it, I feel it, I feel it
Itâs as if it binds me tightly
Your love is enveloping me
When she calls my name, it feels so good

Youâre the one I love, and I want you
And I also need you
When weâre close, I feel weâll be together forever
No one can come between us

Oh na na na eh
King King Promise
When it feels like itâs all weighing on me
It shows that this queen is truly mine
Early morning when you rest your head on me
Lean on me with confidence, and I'm all yours
In the dark, itâs just the two of us
Everyone else fades away
Just you and me holding close
Itâs us against the world
Ever since you came my way
Iâve never felt this way before, before, before
No worries, Iâll hold you tight
I keep your heart, girl
Iâll never let you go
Come on

Listen
I can see my girl from the driveway
She wants me, and I want her tooâwhat can I say
Anything we do, we do it our way
How many times weâve kissed all day
Even the people in Germany would say âsheisseâ (wow)
When I see her, Iâm amazed
Sheâs been with me from nothing to payday
My love, my queen
Girl, I want a kiss
Can you give it to me just like that
Letâs go shopping and forget the prices
When Iâm close to you, I feel transformed
My heart races for you, itâs like a crisis
But Iâm so happy with you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life

Love me passionately like Shaolin
Tonight, Iâll play my violin for you
My girl loves the way I am
She says Iâm exciting
Girl, your body is enticing
Iâm holding on tight, wanting it sweet

Oh na na na eh
King King Promise
When it feels like itâs all weighing on me
It shows that this queen is truly mine
Early morning when you rest your head on me
Lean on me with confidence, and I'm all yours
In the dark, itâs just the two of us
Everyone else fades away
Just you and me holding close
Itâs us against the world
Ever since you came my way
Iâve never felt this way before, before, before
No worries, Iâll hold you tight
I keep your heart, girl
Iâll never let you go
Come on

Listen
I can see my girl from the driveway
She wants me, and I want her tooâwhat can I say
Anything we do, we do it our way
How many times weâve kissed all day
Even the people in Germany would say âsheisseâ (wow)
When I see her, Iâm amazed
Sheâs been with me from nothing to payday
My love, my queen
Girl, I want a kiss
Can you give it to me just like that
Letâs go shopping and forget the prices
When Iâm close to you, I feel transformed
My heart races for you, itâs like a crisis
But Iâm so happy with you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life

Girl, youâve got a great body and a sweet face
True love walking on the beach
Day and night, by your side
Our connection is always on, never like prepaid
You deserve all the Gucci and Balmain
Itâs not only me who loves youâeveryone admires you
Love me passionately like Shaolin
Tonight, Iâll play my violin for you
My girl loves the way I am
She says Iâm exciting
Girl, your body is enticing
Iâm holding on tight, wanting it sweet
Take care of my heart, and Iâll be watching over you
I want to do the right thing

Oh na na na eh
King King Promise
When it feels like itâs all weighing on me
It shows that this queen is truly mine
Early morning when you rest your head on me
Lean on me with confidence, and I'm all yours
In the dark, itâs just the two of us
Everyone else fades away
Just you and me holding close
Itâs us against the world
Ever since you came my way
Iâve never felt this way before, before, before
No worries, Iâll hold you tight
I keep your heart, girl
Iâll never let you go
Come on

I can see my girl from the driveway
She wants me, and I want her tooâwhat can I say
Anything we do, we do it our way
How many times weâve kissed all day
Even the people in Germany would say âsheisseâ (wow)
When I see her, Iâm amazed
Sheâs been with me from nothing to payday
My love, my queen
Girl, I want a kiss
Can you give it to me just like that
Letâs go shopping and forget the prices
When Iâm close to you, I feel transformed
My heart races for you, itâs like a crisis
But Iâm so happy with you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life

Girl, youâve got a great body and a sweet face
True love walking on the beach
Day and night, by your side
Our connection is always on, never like prepaid
You deserve all the Gucci and Balmain
Itâs not only me who loves youâeveryone admires you
Love me passionately like Shaolin
Tonight, Iâll play my violin for you
My girl loves the way I am
She says Iâm exciting
Girl, your body is enticing
Iâm holding on tight, wanting it sweet
Take care of my heart, and Iâll be watching over you

Oh na na na eh
King King Promise
When it feels like itâs all weighing on me
It shows that this queen is truly mine
Early morning when you rest your head on me
Lean on me with confidence, and I'm all yours
In the dark, itâs just the two of us
Everyone else fades away
Just you and me holding close
Itâs us against the world
Ever since you came my way
Iâve never felt this way before, before, before
No worries, Iâll hold you tight
I keep your heart, girl
Iâll never let you go
Come on
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought Iâd fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi o
Haah
What else obidiponbidi
Listen
I can see my girl from the driveway
She wants me, and I want her tooâwhat can I say
Anything we do, we do it our way
How many times weâve kissed all day
Even the people in Germany would say âsheisseâ (wow)
When I see her, Iâm amazed
Sheâs been with me from nothing to payday
My love, my queen
Girl, I want a kiss
Can you give it to me just like that
Letâs go shopping and forget the prices
When Iâm close to you, I feel transformed
My heart races for you, itâs like a crisis
But Iâm so happy with you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life
Listen to the song I sing
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought Iâd fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi o
Haah
Listen
Girl, youâve got a great body and a sweet face
True love walking on the beach
Day and night, by your side
Our connection is always on, never like prepaid
You deserve all the Gucci and Balmain
Itâs not only me who loves youâeveryone admires you
Love me passionately like Shaolin
Tonight, Iâll play my violin for you
My girl loves the way I am
She says Iâm exciting
Girl, your body is enticing
Iâm holding on tight, wanting it sweet
Take care of my heart, and Iâll be watching over you
I want to do the right thing
Put a ring on it, so I never look away
Big cars, more money, come and sweeten my life
Listen to the song I sing
Ogbagbemi ee
Ogbagbemi oo
I never thought Iâd fall in love like this again

Iâve never felt this way before, before, before

I never thought Iâd fall in love like this again
Ogbagbemi ee

Verse 1
Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and letâs stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart
Verse 2
Listen, yeah
See, my baby makes me realize
That the groupies and side chicks are all lies
They wear bikinis intentionally to show their thighs
But nobody compares to my baby because theyâre low-price
My girlâs body even makes guys call her âTundraâ
And her body fits perfectly
Like Daddy Lumbaâs lyrics
If I could touch her, Iâd be holding on forever
I even have a carpenter at my place because every night my bed breaks
Yeah, some guys try to act wise
Thatâs why I stay focused
Following me like a uniform
Even when Iâm private, sheâs there like a backpack
Because there are guys I canât trust, so I stand firm
You agree, right?

Yeah, you see the way you give me perfect love
If you give it to me tonight, Iâll sleep so well
I want to marry you, so I break down prayer walls
Let me lock you down because thereâs too much gossip
My testimony is meeting you was a blessing
Even if I wasnât your type
You took me seriously; a local rapper isnât your type
(No!)
What you have isnât just money, it isnât just hype
They just want you for being like Davido, Olamide, and Ice
Finally, you satisfied my soul like the Holy Ghost
Yesterday I was a copper, today Iâm gold

Girl, I wanna take you personally

Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and letâs stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart
Verse 2
Listen, yeah
See, my baby makes me realize
That the groupies and side chicks are all lies
They wear bikinis intentionally to show their thighs
But nobody compares to my baby because theyâre low-price
My girlâs body even makes guys call her âTundraâ
And her body fits perfectly
Like Daddy Lumbaâs lyrics
If I could touch her, Iâd be holding on forever
I even have a carpenter at my place because every night my bed breaks
Yeah, some guys try to act wise
Thatâs why I stay focused
Following me like a uniform
Even when Iâm private, sheâs there like a backpack
Because there are guys I canât trust, so I stand firm
You agree, right?

Verse 7
Yeah, you see the way you give me perfect love
If you give it to me tonight, Iâll sleep so well
I want to marry you, so I break down prayer walls
Let me lock you down because thereâs too much gossip
My testimony is meeting you was a blessing
Even if I wasnât your type
You took me seriously; a local rapper isnât your type
(No!)
What you have isnât just money, it isnât just hype
They just want you for being like Davido, Olamide, and Ice
Finally, you satisfied my soul like the Holy Ghost
Yesterday I was a copper, today Iâm gold
Yeah, it took me so long to get you
Now that I have you
Iâll never let you go, I swear by Allah

But nobody compares to my baby because theyâre low-price
My girlâs body even makes guys call her âTundraâ
And her body fits perfectly
Like Daddy Lumbaâs lyrics
If I could touch her, Iâd be holding on forever
I even have a carpenter at my place because every night my bed breaks
Yeah, some guys try to act wise
Thatâs why I stay focused
Following me like a uniform
Even when Iâm private, sheâs there like a backpack
Because there are guys I canât trust, so I stand firm
You agree, right?
Chorus
Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and letâs stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart
Verse 11
Yeah, you see the way you give me perfect love
If you give it to me tonight, Iâll sleep so well
I want to marry you, so I break down prayer walls
Let me lock you down because thereâs too much gossip
My testimony is meeting you was a blessing
Even if I wasnât your type
You took me seriously; a local rapper isnât your type
(No!)
What you have isnât just money, it isnât just hype
They just want you for being like Davido, Olamide, and Ice
Finally, you satisfied my soul like the Holy Ghost
Yesterday I was a copper, today Iâm gold
Yeah, it took me so long to get you
Now that I have you
Iâll never let you go, I swear by Allah
Chorus
Baby, mad for your body oo (obidiponbidi)
I'm crazy for your body oo
I sing for your body oo, sing for my honey oo
My lady, mad for your body oo
I'm crazy for your body eeh eh

Your body go kill me, now!
Obidiponbidi
Runtown
Now! yeah
Chale your body go kill me
What else
When will you come?
Chorus
Baby, mad for your body oo (obidiponbidi)
I'm crazy for your body oo
I sing for your body oo
Baby, mad for your body oo (obidiponbidi)
I'm crazy for your body eeh eh
Anything for your body oo
Verse 1
Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and letâs stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart
Verse 2
Listen, yeah
See, my baby makes me realize
That the groupies and side chicks are all lies
They wear bikinis intentionally to show their thighs
But nobody compares to my baby because theyâre low-price
My girlâs body even makes guys call her âTundraâ
And her body fits perfectly
Like Daddy Lumbaâs lyrics
If I could touch her, Iâd be holding on forever
I even have a carpenter at my place because every night my bed breaks
Yeah, some guys try to act wise
Thatâs why I stay focused
Following me like a uniform
Even when Iâm private, sheâs there like a backpack
Because there are guys I canât trust, so I stand firm
You agree, right?
Chorus
Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and letâs stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart
Verse 16
Yeah, you see the way you give me perfect love
If you give it to me tonight, Iâll sleep so well
I want to marry you, so I break down prayer walls
Let me lock you down because thereâs too much gossip
My testimony is meeting you was a blessing
Even if I wasnât your type
You took me seriously; a local rapper isnât your type
(No!)
What you have isnât just money, it isnât just hype
They just want you for being like Davido, Olamide, and Ice
Finally, you satisfied my soul like the Holy Ghost
Yesterday I was a copper, today Iâm gold
Yeah, it took me so long to get you
Now that I have you
Iâll never let you go, I swear by Allah
Chorus
Baby, mad for your body oo (obidiponbidi)
I'm crazy for your body oo
I sing for your body oo, sing for my honey oo
My lady, mad for your body oo
I'm crazy for your body eeh eh
Anything for your body oo
Outro
Girl, I wanna take you personally
Fight for you like a wrestler
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Baby, your body is like a key to my heart, oh, key to my heart
Beautiful lady, my beloved, come and letâs stay together
Stay by your side like a painkiller
Sweetie, your body is like a key to my heart
Ah, you know what time it is
