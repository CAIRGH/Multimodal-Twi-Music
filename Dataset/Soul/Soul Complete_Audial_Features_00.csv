And my hair is all a mess
I don't fret, I don't worry
Pull up a bun, then I'm off in a hurry
In a taxi down to Osu
My messy fro begins to shrink
But I don't fret, I don't worry
My coily crownâs getting some love
I love my braids and Bantu knots
My twists and sister locks
I want my kinky braids crocheted
My curls and Marley locks displayed
I just love it like that, ooo
I look amazing, I look beautiful
Brand new hair, brand new me
And when you're feeling super quirky
And when you miss your local roots
Pull out those clips and comb the afro
Then maybe stretch it with some thread
And if you're feeling super sassy
And when your mane has got that glow
Shake out those tresses, lay those edges
Thereâs nothing sassier than your fro
I love my braids and Bantu knots
My twists and sister locks
I want my kinky braids crocheted
My curls and Marley locks displayed
I just love it like that, ooo
I look amazing, I look beautiful
Brand new hair, brand new me

Rocking that cut or that bun

Cina Soul
Verse 1: Akwaboah & Cina Soul This is the kind of love that wants me
She knows what to do to make me feel at ease
This is the kind of love that wants me
When I drink water, I call her name
When I pray, I mention her name after it
This is the kind of love that wants me
You, with this love, have disturbed my mind
When I wake up in the morning, I think about you
When I sleep, youâre on my mind again
I canât sit still when sheâs not by my side
When I see her, I canât even speak
This love I have is the kind that wants me
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
Verse 2: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
I need someone to call my own
Only I can say this
Now Iâve found someone to sit on my throne
Oh, I call her my queen, and she calls me her king
This love is life itself
I canât stay away from her
Hey, if I give someone my heart, it wouldnât just be a toy
It will be as vast as the ocean in the Ashanti land
Unbreakable love, itâs only you and I till death
You know how I am
You know how I am, oh
You know how I am, oh
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
Outro: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world
Just to love her alone
If she leaves me
I have no one else
Uh, I came into this world
Just to love her alone, just to love her alone
Oh, my dear love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
My dear love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
My dear love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
My dear love
I love you more than anyone",Soul,"The song expresses unwavering love and commitment, highlighting the depth of the singer's devotion to their partner.

Cina Soul
Verse 1: Akwaboah & Cina Soul This is the kind of love that wants me
She knows what to do to make me feel at ease
This is the kind of love that wants me
When I drink water, I call her name
When I pray, I mention her name after it
This is the kind of love that wants me
You, with this love, have disturbed my mind
When I wake up in the morning, I think about you
When I sleep, youâre on my mind again
I canât sit still when sheâs not by my side
When I see her, I canât even speak
This love I have is the kind that wants me
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
Verse 2: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
I need someone to call my own
Only I can say this
Now Iâve found someone to sit on my throne
Oh, I call her my queen, and she calls me her king
This love is life itself
I canât stay away from her
Hey, if I give someone my heart, it wouldnât just be a toy
It will be as vast as the ocean in the Ashanti land
Unbreakable love, itâs only you and I till death
You know how I am
You know how I am, oh
You know how I am, oh
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone

Cina Soul
Verse 1: Akwaboah & Cina Soul This is the kind of love that wants me
She knows what to do to make me feel at ease
This is the kind of love that wants me
When I drink water, I call her name
When I pray, I mention her name after it
This is the kind of love that wants me
You, with this love, have disturbed my mind
When I wake up in the morning, I think about you
When I sleep, youâre on my mind again
I canât sit still when sheâs not by my side
When I see her, I canât even speak
This love I have is the kind that wants me
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
Verse 2: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
I need someone to call my own
Only I can say this
Now Iâve found someone to sit on my throne
Oh, I call her my queen, and she calls me her king
This love is life itself
I canât stay away from her
Hey, if I give someone my heart, it wouldnât just be a toy
It will be as vast as the ocean in the Ashanti land
Unbreakable love, itâs only you and I till death
You know how I am
You know how I am, oh
You know how I am, oh
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
Outro: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world

She knows what to do to make me feel at ease
This is the kind of love that wants me
When I drink water, I call her name
When I pray, I mention her name after it
This is the kind of love that wants me
You, with this love, have disturbed my mind
When I wake up in the morning, I think about you
When I sleep, youâre on my mind again
I canât sit still when sheâs not by my side
When I see her, I canât even speak
This love I have is the kind that wants me
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
Verse 2: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
I need someone to call my own
Only I can say this
Now Iâve found someone to sit on my throne
Oh, I call her my queen, and she calls me her king
This love is life itself
I canât stay away from her
Hey, if I give someone my heart, it wouldnât just be a toy
It will be as vast as the ocean in the Ashanti land
Unbreakable love, itâs only you and I till death
You know how I am
You know how I am, oh
You know how I am, oh
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)

Verse 2: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
I need someone to call my own
Only I can say this
Now Iâve found someone to sit on my throne
Oh, I call her my queen, and she calls me her king
This love is life itself
I canât stay away from her
Hey, if I give someone my heart, it wouldnât just be a toy
It will be as vast as the ocean in the Ashanti land
Unbreakable love, itâs only you and I till death
You know how I am
You know how I am, oh
You know how I am, oh
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
Outro: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world
Just to love her alone
If she leaves me
I have no one else
Uh, I came into this world
Just to love her alone, just to love her alone
Oh, my dear love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
My dear love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
My dear love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
My dear love

Cina Soul
Verse 1: Akwaboah & Cina Soul This is the kind of love that wants me
She knows what to do to make me feel at ease
This is the kind of love that wants me
When I drink water, I call her name
When I pray, I mention her name after it
This is the kind of love that wants me
You, with this love, have disturbed my mind
When I wake up in the morning, I think about you
When I sleep, youâre on my mind again
I canât sit still when sheâs not by my side
When I see her, I canât even speak
This love I have is the kind that wants me
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, Iâll never have anyone else)

Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)

When the day breaks, I close my eyes
I close my eyes and see your image
My darling, my baby
You're driving me crazy
People are saying that I do things like you
And even now, they say Iâm like you
I speak like you, I love you
Thatâs why I give you all my heart and soul
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
To a special place
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
To a special place
Itâs like Iâve told you that I got you
You can feel my love, just that alone, Iâll catch you
They say weâre perfect for each other, they say I match you
Weâre a better pair, like a jellytone bear, stuck like a tattoo
We donât have to run away, weâll stay right here
Weâve been through a lot, this isnât even close to a nightmare
Look, our love feels like an offering in a church
Can't wait for the day we see each other and my child
But until then, it's me and you against the world
Donât be hard on yourself, be a woman, not a girl

Campaign song for your love, give me your vote
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
To a special place
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
To a special place

So love has made people weary
Your heart and mine are tired
And I can't wait until the morning comes
So love has made people weary
Your heart and mine are tired
And I can't wait until the morning comes
I can't wait 'til the morning comes (No, no, no, I can't wait)
So I see your face, my favourite one
I wanna see your face
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
Here, we run away
Here, we run away (I wanna see your face)
To a special place (My baby)
Here, we run away (Can we run away?)
Here, we run away

When the day breaks,

When the day breaks, I close my eyes
I close my eyes and see your image
My darling, my baby
You're driving me crazy
People are saying that I do things like you
And even now, they say Iâm like you
I speak like you, I love you
Thatâs why I give you all my heart and soul
Here, we run away

You can feel my love, just that alone, Iâll catch you
They say weâre perfect for each other, they say I match you
Weâre a better pair, like a jellytone bear, stuck like a tattoo
We donât have to run away, weâll stay right here
Weâve been through a lot, this isnât even close to a nightmare
Look, our love feels like an offering in a church
Can't wait for the day we see each other and my child
But until then, it's me and you against the world
Donât be hard on yourself, be a woman, not a girl
Ah, when the day breaks, itâll light up my darkness and erase the suffering
Thoughts of you fill my mind like a chair and a table
Look, I just wanna tell you how I feel

Your heart and mine are tired
And I can't wait until the morning comes

She shivers when Iâm not there
Sheâs cocoa, so Iâm the koose
If youâre Barcelona, Iâll be your Messi
She has a Coca-Cola body shape
Iâm the Pepsi
Come, come
Araba, come oh Araba
Araba, come oh
Araba, let's go

She says ""me, me"" and she wants it oh
Itâs me
Itâs me the way she wants, itâs me
Me, me
She says she wants it oh
Itâs me, me, me
She says she wants to come
And roll with daddy
Me too, I wonât slack in her body
What do I gain if I donât touch her right spot and make her mind burst
And turn her to my shawty
What you do to me, I fall hard
Enemanimo, youâre not playing so oh
She wonât let you touch
Sheâs a gyimito
She wants a real guy whoâs around
Like her silly pose
IG next stop is Miami
Face like glorying
Shape like Naomi
Bus she reads for Paris, are you on it?
Iâm not boring
You want a twist? On it
I said Iâm here
Iâm a problem, you know
Between me and your boyfriend
She says ""me"" she wants
She says ""me, me"" and she wants it oh
Itâs me

Dadie anoma (the bird),
will take my letter to love
Those small, small fights
we should have them then avoid them
But that's exactly what even makes me miss you more
I don't know what is wrong with expressing how I feel
You don't know what is wrong, especially how I feel
Love, that's how it feels, so I don't turn my back on you
You know you're the reason I'm going to sing this song
You got me singing like you, me, K-I-S-S-I-N-G now
You, me. Small fights are no big deal
You, me, F-U-C-K-I-N-G now
Maybe we should make up, we donât have to break up, oh no
The issue is small but you've made it big
What have I not said, have you heard me?
Today, fight, tomorrow you will see and we'll talk
I don't even care to call it a bother
But I think about it before I sleep
Love, I am stubborn, and so are you
I often chase after you, and you chase after me too
Love, I am stubborn, and so are you
I often chase after you, and you chase after me too

Dadie anoma (the bird),
will take my letter to love
Those small, small fights
we should have them then avoid them
But that's exactly what even makes me miss you more
I don't know what is wrong with expressing how I feel
You don't know what is wrong, especially how I feel
Love, that's how it feels, so I don't turn my back on you
You know you're the reason I'm going to sing this song
You got me singing like you, me, K-I-S-S-I-N-G now
You, me. Small fights are no big deal
You, me, F-U-C-K-I-N-G now
Maybe we should make up, we donât have to break up, oh no
The issue is small but you've made it big
What have I not said, have you heard me?
Today, fight, tomorrow you will see and we'll talk
I don't even care to call it a bother
But I think about it before I sleep
Love, I am stubborn, and so are you
I often chase after you, and you chase after me too
Love, I am stubborn, and so are you
I often chase after you, and you chase after me too

You got me singing like you, me, K-I-S-S-I-N-G now
You, me. Small fights are no big deal
You, me, F-U-C-K-I-N-G now
Maybe we should make up, we donât have to break up, oh no
The issue is small but you've made it big
What have I not said, have you heard me?
Today, fight, tomorrow you will see and we'll talk
I don't even care to call it a bother
But I think about it before I sleep
Love, I am stubborn, and so are you
I often chase after you, and you chase after me too
Love, I am stubborn, and so are you
I often chase after you, and you chase after me too
Got me going like you, me, K-I-S-S-I-N-G now
You, me. Small fights are no big deal
You, me, F-U-C-K-I-N-G now
Maybe we should make up, we donât have to break up, oh no
I donât know what is wrong with expressing how I feel
You donât know what is wrong, especially how I feel
Love, that's how it feels, so I donât turn my back on you

You got me singing like you, me, K-I-S-S-I-N-G now
You, me. Small fights are no big deal
You, me, F-U-C-K-I-N-G now
Maybe we should make up, we donât have to break up, oh no",Soul,"The song expresses the ups and downs of a romantic relationship, where despite small fights and misunderstandings, the couple's love and attraction remain strong. The singer is torn between expressing their feelings and making up, emphasizing the desire to stay together and not break up over minor issues.

In this world, no one marries their enemy,
But I swear by the love I have for you,
I have such great love for you,
My love,
No one compares to you,
You are my beautiful,
I love you from the core of my heart,
Nothing will separate us,
No one else compares to you,
My love, my love,
I love you, and you love me,
I will love you forever,
Love me, and I will love you forever,
Some more, more,
Please donât betray me,
Take the lead, and I will follow,
My precious lover, my desired woman,
You are my living water, my love,
It's tough to be lonely,
So, donât leave me behind,
Donât leave me behind.
Love me, love me,
Love me, love me, love me,
Love me, love me, love me, love me,
I just want to show you love,
I just want to love you more,
My love, donât leave me behind,
Take the lead, and I will follow,
Please do not betray me,
My precious lover, my desired woman,
Itâs tough to be lonely,
So, donât leave me behind.
When two go hunting,
They are the same two who go fetching,
The right hand tends to the left,
And the left tends to the right,
Forgive me when I fault you,
Forgive me because love is infallible,
I want you more than you can imagine,
Because I love you, I will not mistreat you,
My love, you are the only one in my heart,
In my mind and my soul,
I put no one else before you,
No one else compares, my love,
Please donât betray me,
Take the lead, and I will follow,
My precious lover, my desired woman,
You are my living water, my love,
It's tough to be lonely,
So donât leave me behind,
Donât leave me behind.
Please donât leave me behind,
It's tough to be lonely,
So, my love, donât leave me behind,
Donât listen to anybody,
People envy the way you are,
Nowhere else compares,
My love, it will get better,
Please donât betray me,
Take the lead, and I will follow,
My precious lover, my desired woman,
You are my living water, my love,
It's tough to be lonely,
So donât leave me behind,
Donât leave me behind.
My love, my love,
Please donât leave me behind,
Take the lead, and I will follow,
My precious lover, my desired woman,
You are my living water, my love,
Itâs tough to be lonely,

But the silence grows louder, it's too much to bear.
Revive my soul, let your touch set me free,
In your light, Iâll find the strength to just be.
Chorus
Oya, put me to sleep, take my burdens away,
This low energyâs pulling my spirit astray.
Reignite my flame, let me feel the dream,
Bring me peace and balance, make it serene.
Outro
Where are you? I'm still calling your name,
Through every tear, every whisper of pain.
Show me you, be my guiding light,
Bring me solace in the dark of night.",Soul,"The song expresses a deep yearning for comfort, energy, and peace, as the singer feels drained and restless in their search for someone or something to rejuvenate them. It conveys a sense of vulnerability and longing for connection to escape emotional or physical exhaustion. Ultimately, the lyrics highlight the desire for healing, renewal, and a sense of serenity amidst life's struggles.
