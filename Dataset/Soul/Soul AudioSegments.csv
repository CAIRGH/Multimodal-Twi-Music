And my hair is all a mess
I don't fret, I don't worry
Pull up a bun, then I'm off in a hurry
In a taxi down to Osu
My messy fro begins to shrink
But I don't fret, I don't worry
My coily crown’s getting some love
I love my braids and Bantu knots
My twists and sister locks
I want my kinky braids crocheted
My curls and Marley locks displayed
I just love it like that, ooo
I look amazing, I look beautiful
Brand new hair, brand new me
And when you're feeling super quirky
And when you miss your local roots
Pull out those clips and comb the afro
Then maybe stretch it with some thread
And if you're feeling super sassy
And when your mane has got that glow
Shake out those tresses, lay those edges
There’s nothing sassier than your fro
I love my braids and Bantu knots
My twists and sister locks
I want my kinky braids crocheted
My curls and Marley locks displayed
I just love it like that, ooo
I look amazing, I look beautiful
Brand new hair, brand new me
Whether you’re scarfed or you’re bald
Ooooo
Rocking that cut or that bun
Ooooo
Whether in dreads or you’re dyed
Be your own beautiful
Be your own beautiful",Soul,"The song celebrates the beauty, versatility, and pride of natural hair, encouraging self-love and confidence in embracing one's unique look and cultural heritage.

Cina Soul
Verse 1: Akwaboah & Cina Soul This is the kind of love that wants me
She knows what to do to make me feel at ease
This is the kind of love that wants me
When I drink water, I call her name
When I pray, I mention her name after it
This is the kind of love that wants me
You, with this love, have disturbed my mind
When I wake up in the morning, I think about you
When I sleep, you’re on my mind again
I can’t sit still when she’s not by my side
When I see her, I can’t even speak
This love I have is the kind that wants me
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, I’ll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, I’ll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
Unbreakable love, oh (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
Verse 2: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
I need someone to call my own
Only I can say this
Now I’ve found someone to sit on my throne
Oh, I call her my queen, and she calls me her king
This love is life itself
I can’t stay away from her
Hey, if I give someone my heart, it wouldn’t just be a toy
It will be as vast as the ocean in the Ashanti land
Unbreakable love, it’s only you and I till death
You know how I am
You know how I am, oh
You know how I am, oh
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, I’ll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)
If you leave me (I have no one else, I’ll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)

Verse 2: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
I need someone to call my own
Only I can say this
Now I’ve found someone to sit on my throne
Oh, I call her my queen, and she calls me her king
This love is life itself
I can’t stay away from her
Hey, if I give someone my heart, it wouldn’t just be a toy
It will be as vast as the ocean in the Ashanti land
Unbreakable love, it’s only you and I till death
You know how I am
You know how I am, oh
You know how I am, oh
Chorus: Akwaboah & Cina Soul
Uh, I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
So if she leaves me (I have no one else, I’ll never have anyone else)
I came into this world (Just to love her alone, just to love her alone)
Oh, my love (My dear love)
I love you more than anyone
I came into this world (Just to love you alone, just to love you alone)

You know how I am
You know how I am, oh

I close my eyes and see your image
My darling, my baby
You're driving me crazy (You're driving me crazy)
Yeah, you know the name, right?",Soul,"The song expresses deep love and devotion, with the narrator yearning to be close to their partner in a special and intimate way. It highlights the desire to escape the challenges of the world and find peace in each other's presence. The lyrics convey a sense of mutual affection, where both partners are committed to each other and their love, despite the outside world's opinions."

We don’t have to run away, we’ll stay right here
We’ve been through a lot, this isn’t even close to a nightmare
Look, our love feels like an offering in a church
Can't wait for the day we see each other and my child
But until then, it's me and you against the world
Don’t be hard on yourself, be a woman, not a girl
Ah, when the day breaks, it’ll light up my darkness and erase the suffering
Thoughts of you fill my mind like a chair and a table
Look, I just wanna tell you how I feel

It’s me, me, me
The way she whines for me, I go
I say she’s a real bad girl, I tell about that
She spins out for me
I slide the thing one time
She doesn’t give me enough chat
Well
She shivers when I’m not there
She’s cocoa, so I’m the koose
If you’re Barcelona, I’ll be your Messi
She has a Coca-Cola body shape
I’m the Pepsi
Come, come

She says she wants to come
And roll with daddy
Me too, I won’t slack in her body
What do I gain if I don’t touch her right spot and make her mind burst
And turn her to my shawty
What you do to me, I fall hard
Enemanimo, you’re not playing so oh
She won’t let you touch
She’s a gyimito
She wants a real guy who’s around
Like her silly pose
IG next stop is Miami
Face like glorying
Shape like Naomi
Bus she reads for Paris, are you on it?
I’m not boring
You want a twist? On it
I said I’m here
I’m a problem, you know
Between me and your boyfriend
She says ""me"" she wants
She says ""me, me"" and she wants it oh

Another, another
Well
My baby, give me all I want
Early morning, she gives me
I eat oh
In the bedroom, she’s the boss
She gives me sugar, pineapple, and coconut oh
Baby, never leave my hand
I’ll give you all my bank account
For you, I drop the big sound oh
She says ""me, me"" and she wants it oh
It's me
It's me the way she wants, it's me
Me, me
She says she wants it oh
It’s me, me, me
The way she whines for me, I go
I say she’s a real bad girl, I tell about that
She spins out for me
I slide the thing one time
She doesn’t give me enough chat
Well
She shivers when I’m not there
She’s cocoa, so I’m the koose
If you’re Barcelona, I’ll be your Messi
She has a Coca-Cola body shape
I’m the Pepsi
Come, come
Araba, come oh Araba
Araba, come oh
Araba, let's go
My horse is fast
She says ""me, me"" and she wants it oh
It’s me
It’s me the way she wants, it’s me
Me, me
She says she wants it oh
It’s me, me, me
She says she wants to come
And roll with daddy
Me too, I won’t slack in her body
What do I gain if I don’t touch her right spot and make her mind burst
And turn her to my shawty
What you do to me, I fall hard
Enemanimo, you’re not playing so oh
She won’t let you touch
She’s a gyimito
She wants a real guy who’s around
Like her silly pose
IG next stop is Miami
Face like glorying
Shape like Naomi
Bus she reads for Paris, are you on it?
I’m not boring
You want a twist? On it
I said I’m here
I’m a problem, you know
Between me and your boyfriend
She says ""me"" she wants
She says ""me, me"" and she wants it oh
It’s me
It’s me the way she wants, it’s me
Me, me
She says she wants it oh
It’s me, me, me
Oh, I want
Another, another one
It’s me the way she wants",Soul,"The song expresses a passionate and playful relationship where the speaker is deeply infatuated with his partner, who loves and desires him in return. It highlights the physical attraction, emotional connection, and mutual devotion they share, with the speaker emphasizing that no one else can love her the way he does. The song also reflects a sense of fun, confidence, and exclusivity in their bond, as they are portrayed as a perfect match."

Looking for a glimpse, a trace of you near me.
Show yourself, don't keep me lost in this maze,
I've been wandering in shadows, longing for your gaze.
Chorus
Oya, put me to sleep, take my worries away,
This restlessness grows stronger with each passing day.
The energy is fading, I’m slipping so deep,
Let me feel the fantasy and help me to sleep.
Verse 2
I feel my strength draining, my spirit running dry,
Caught in this emptiness, beneath a weary sky.
Give me your energy, bring me back to life,
Let your presence heal me, cut through this strife.
Bridge
I’m holding on to whispers of hope in the air,
But the silence grows louder, it's too much to bear.
Revive my soul, let your touch set me free,
In your light, I’ll find the strength to just be.
Chorus
Oya, put me to sleep, take my burdens away,
This low energy’s pulling my spirit astray.
Reignite my flame, let me feel the dream,
Bring me peace and balance, make it serene.
