And my hair is all a mess
I don't fret, I don't worry
Pull up a bun, then I'm off in a hurry
In a taxi down to Osu
My messy fro begins to shrink
But I don't fret, I don't worry
My coily crownâs getting some love
I love my braids and Bantu knots
My twists and sister locks
I want my kinky braids crocheted
My curls and Marley locks displayed
I just love it like that, ooo
I look amazing, I look beautiful
Brand new hair, brand new me
And when you're feeling super quirky
And when you miss your local roots
Pull out those clips and comb the afro
Then maybe stretch it with some thread
And if you're feeling super sassy
And when your mane has got that glow
Shake out those tresses, lay those edges
Thereâs nothing sassier than your fro
I love my braids and Bantu knots
My twists and sister locks
I want my kinky braids crocheted

In a taxi down to Osu
My messy fro begins to shrink
But I don't fret, I don't worry
My coily crownâs getting some love
I love my braids and Bantu knots
My twists and sister locks
I want my kinky braids crocheted
My curls and Marley locks displayed
I just love it like that, ooo
I look amazing, I look beautiful
Brand new hair, brand new me
And when you're feeling super quirky
And when you miss your local roots
Pull out those clips and comb the afro
Then maybe stretch it with some thread
And if you're feeling super sassy
And when your mane has got that glow
Shake out those tresses, lay those edges
Thereâs nothing sassier than your fro
I love my braids and Bantu knots
My twists and sister locks
I want my kinky braids crocheted
My curls and Marley locks displayed
I just love it like that, ooo
I look amazing, I look beautiful
Brand new hair, brand new me
Whether youâre scarfed or youâre bald
Ooooo
Rocking that cut or that bun
Ooooo
Whether in dreads or youâre dyed
Be your own beautiful
Be your own beautiful",Soul
